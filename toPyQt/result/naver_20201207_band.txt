We detail the synthetic approaches to low band gap polymer materials starting from the early methodologies employing quinoid homopolymer structures to the current state of the art that relies on alternating copolymers of donor and acceptor groups where strategies for band gap design are possible. Current challenges for OPV such as chemical stability and energy level alignment are discussed. We finally provide a compilation of the most studied classes of low band gap materials and the results obtained in photovoltaic applications and give a tabular overview of rarely applied materials.,,eng,naver

Fitzgerald",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat1310,,"Dilute ferromagnetic oxides having Curie temperatures far in excess of 300 K and exceptionally large ordered moments per transition-metal cation challenge our understanding of magnetism in solids. These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xδ)1/2 where x and δ are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism.",,eng,naver

This can be achieved by employing a nonlinear response of metamaterials. We demonstrate that, with an appropriate design, a frequency band exceeding 100% is available for a range of signal amplitudes. Our proposal provides a significant improvement over the linear approach, opening a road towards broadband negative refraction and its applications.",,eng,naver
