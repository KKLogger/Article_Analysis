Here we construct, date and analyse a species-level phylogeny of nearly all extant Mammalia to bring a new perspective to this question. Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that the phylogenetic ‘fuses’ leading to the explosion of extant placental orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously, but also challenge the hypothesis that the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event had a major, direct influence on the diversification of today’s mammals.",,eng,naver

Although the molecular genetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day (LD) plant, has provided models to explain the control of flowering time in this species2,3,4, very little is known about its molecular mechanisms for short-day (SD) plants. Here we show how the photoperiodic control of flowering is regulated in rice, a SD plant. Overexpression of OsGI5, an orthologue of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI) gene6,7 in transgenic rice, caused late flowering under both SD and LD conditions. Expression of the rice orthologue8 of the Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) gene9 was increased in the transgenic rice, whereas expression of the rice orthologue10 of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)11,12 was suppressed.

However, it is still unknown whether HPA axis responses to psychological stress are affected by time of day and whether they can be assessed with equal reliability in the morning and afternoon, respectively.The present reanalysis is based on five independent studies conducted in the same laboratory by Kirschbaum et al., 1999, Kudielka et al., 1998, Kudielka et al., 1999, Kudielka et al., 2000 and Schommer et al. (2003). All subjects were confronted with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) either in the morning or in the afternoon. The total sample consisted of 180 adults with 115 younger (49 females, 66 males) and 65 older adults (32 females, 33 males). All ANCOVA results controlled for possible age and gender effects. Stress-related free salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol and ACTH net increases did not differ according to time of day (all p = n.s.). However, as expected pre-stress free salivary and total plasma cortisol levels differed significantly between the morning and afternoon group (both p < 0.005), leading to a significantly higher free cortisol area under the curve (AUC) in the morning (p = 0.02). Taken together, these observations suggest that the adrenal glands may be more sensitive to ACTH in the morning. Additionally, higher basal salivary cortisol levels were related to a lower stress-related net increase in salivary cortisol (p = 0.02), total plasma cortisol (p < 0.0001), and marginally ACTH (p = 0.09). Stress-related heart rate increases did not differ between groups (p = n.s.). The finding that the TSST-induced mood change was differentially affected by time of day requires further exploration.We conclude that comparable HPA axis and heart rate stress responses to psychosocial stress can be measured in the morning and afternoon.",,eng,naver

During glacial climate stages, for example, the world was much dustier, with dust fluxes two to five times greater than in interglacial stages. However, the influence of dust on climate remains a poorly quantified and actively changing element of the Earth's climate system. Dust can influence climate directly, by the scattering and absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly, by modifying cloud properties. Dust transported to the oceans can also affect climate via ocean fertilization in those regions of the world's oceans where macronutrients like nitrate are abundant but primary production and nitrogen fixation are limited by iron scarcity. Dust containing iron, as fine-grained iron oxides/oxyhydroxides and/or within clay minerals, and other essential micronutrients (e.g. silica) may modulate the uptake of carbon in marine ecosystems and, in turn, the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Here, in order to critically examine past fluxes and possible climate impacts of dust in general and iron-bearing dust in particular, we consider present-day sources and properties of dust, synthesise available records of dust deposition at the last glacial maximum (LGM); evaluate the evidence for changes in ocean palaeo-productivity associated with, and possibly caused by, changes in aeolian flux to the oceans at the LGM; and consider the radiative forcing effects of increased LGM dust loadings.",,eng,naver

It should provide a modern reference framework for paleoclimate research in South America, targeting high-resolution proxies over the past few centuries. Several datasets suitable for present-day climate research are first described, highlighting their advantages as well as their limitations. We then provide a basic physical understanding of the mean annual cycle of the precipitation and atmospheric circulation over the continent and the adjacent oceans. In particular, the diversity of precipitation, temperature and wind patterns is interpreted in terms of the long meridional extent of the continent and the disruption of the large-scale circulation caused by the Andes cordillera, the contrasting oceanic boundary conditions and the landmass distribution. Similarly, the intensity and timing of the interannual and interdecadal climatic fluctuations exhibit considerable geographical dependence, as some regions are more influenced by large-scale phenomena rooted in the tropical oceans while others are more influenced by high-latitude phenomena. The impact of these large-scale phenomena over South America is documented by a regression analysis between selected atmospheric indices and the precipitation and temperature fields. We have included a discussion on the seasonality and long-term stability of such impacts, and complemented our general description by an updated review of the literature on climate variability over specific regions.",,eng,naver

The results replicated a previous study showing increases in cortisol levels over the day at childcare for preschool-aged children, while home levels followed the expected circadian decrease in cortisol from morning to afternoon for most children regardless of age. At childcare, 3- and 4-year olds were more likely to show elevations in cortisol by mid-afternoon than were older children.

These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user’s origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user’s home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals’ daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.",,eng,naver

After an implementation/adjustment of a congestion pricing scheme, the network flows in a certain period of days are not on an equilibrium state, thus it is problematic to take the equilibrium-based indexes as the pricing objective. Therefore, the concept of robust optimization is taken for the congestion toll determination problem, which takes into account the network performance of each day. First, a minimax model which minimizes the maximum regret on each day is proposed. Taking as a constraint of the minimax model, a path-based day to day dynamics model under stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) constraints is discussed in this paper. It is difficult to solve this minimax model by exact algorithms because of the implicity of the flow map function. Hence, a two-phase artificial bee colony algorithm is developed to solve the proposed minimax regret model, of which the first phase solves the minimal expected total travel cost for each day and the second phase handles the minimax robust optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example is conducted to validate the proposed models and methods.",,eng,naver

However, breeding-season pregnancy rates were not different among treatments (87.0% for 1 × PGF, 92.9% for 2 × PGF and 87.5% for 1 × CLP; P > 0.1). In conclusion, cows that received two doses of PGF on the day of CIDR removal in a 5-d CO-Synch + CIDR synchronization protocol had excellent timed-AI pregnancy rates that were greater than in cows receiving a single treatment with either PGF or CLP.",,eng,naver

Such an assumption basically ignores the correlation among day-to-day evolution and bounded rationality (BR) of travelers in the path choice and thus could result in inaccurate results for the travelers with such behavior. This paper proposes a day-to-day dynamic evolution model with the consideration of BR, which can better captures travelers’ characteristics in the path finding within an urban railway network. In order to capture the correlation of path choice over time, we introduce a time series method, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), to analyze the complex long-term correlations hiding in the passengers’ evolution over time. The study results clearly show that the proposed model and analytical approach is better for capture the day-to-day dynamics in travel behaviors and can serve as a general framework of modeling passengers’ BR behavior.",• A day-to-day evolution model based on bounded-rationality is developed. • DFA is introduced to capture the correlation of travelers’ route choice decision. • Effects of key factors in URT system on DFA scale exponent are analyzed. • Statistical self-affinity and long range correlation process are discovered.,eng,naver

It has a large (ca. 9 km across) east facing summit collapse structure, the Monte Amarelo collapse, with a probable volume of at least 150–200 km3. For most of its history the Monte Amarelo volcano had a small but productive central vent complex and radial rift zones fed by laterally propagating dykes. Shortly before the collapse the latter were replaced by north–south-trending arrays of en echelon, vertically propagating dykes. Since the Monte Amarelo collapse the scar has partly filled with a new volcano, the Cha das Caldeiras volcano. The summit cone of this volcano, the Pico do Fogo, is a very young feature but has been abandoned in the most recent phase of activity, from the 18th century onwards. The same period has also seen the abandonment of earlier radial rift zones with laterally propagating dykes and their replacement with en echelon arrays of vents fed by vertically propagating dykes. These form an N–S-trending array within the older collapse structure and are associated with seaward displacement of the eastern flank of the volcano within the old collapse structure. The most recent eruptions, those of 1951 and 1995, appear to be associated with episodes of flank instability manifested in N–S surface fissuring and east facing normal faults. These recent structural changes in the volcano parallel those which took place in the Monte Amarelo volcano prior to its collapse.",,eng,naver

One hundred and ninety-nine satellite-only geopotential solutions to degree and order 50 were recomputed per 10-day interval for the period 29 July 2002–27 May 2008 using an improved data editing and solution regularization procedure. These release 2 solutions are significantly improved compared to release 1 solutions, the noise over deserts and oceans in the form of North–South striping being reduced by 20–40%. This is thanks to the tailored regularization of each individual Stokes coefficient applied in the solution procedure, and to a time-variable reference model containing mean annual, semiannual and secular variations for degrees 2–50 towards which the variations per 10-day solution are constrained. It may attenuate signals of the order of a few percent, whereas this always occurs when applying a Gaussian smoother even with a half-width smoothing radius as small as 300 km. The uncertainty of an individual point in the time series of a basin expressed in equivalent water height inferred from the 10-day solutions is approximately 20 mm. Comparison of these 10-day solutions to monthly GRACE project solutions (CSR, GFZ and JPL) shows substantial differences. Even for the largest basin, the Amazon, a 15% difference in annual amplitude is found between CNES release 2 and CSR versus GFZ and JPL. The mass-loss estimates for East and West Greenland vary by 100%. Sometimes clear outliers are detected in the GFZ and JPL solutions when a particular basin is studied, which have to be eliminated. In view of the large differences detected between the time series for specific basins, it is hazardous to draw conclusions based on a single solution.",,eng,naver

Recreation, DOAJ:Environmental Sciences, DOAJ:Earth and Environmental Sciences","The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite has been used to measure temperatures in the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The data used here are from August 2004 to December 2010 and latitudes 75Â° N to 75Â° S. The temperature data reveal the regular presence of a westward-propagating 16-day planetary wave with zonal wavenumber 1. The wave amplitudes maximise in winter at middle to high latitudes, where monthly-mean amplitudes can be as large as ~8 K. Significant wave amplitudes are also observed in the summer-time mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and at lower stratospheric heights of up to ~20 km at middle to high latitudes. Wave amplitudes in the Northern Hemisphere approach values twice as large as those in the Southern Hemisphere. Wave amplitudes are also closely related to mean zonal winds and are largest in regions of strongest eastward flow. There is a reduction in wave amplitudes at the stratopause. No significant wave amplitudes are observed near the equator or in the strongly westward background winds of the atmosphere in summer. This behaviour is interpreted as a consequence of wave/mean-flow interactions. Perturbations in wave amplitude summer MLT are compared to those simultaneously observed in the winter stratosphere of the opposite hemisphere and found to have a correlation coefficient of +0.22, suggesting a small degrees of inter-hemispheric coupling. We interpret this to mean that some of the summer-time MLT wave may originate in the winter stratosphere of the opposite hemisphere and have been ducted across the equator. We do not observe a significant QBO modulation of the 16-day wave amplitude in the polar summer-time MLT. Wave amplitudes were also observed to be suppressed during the major sudden stratospheric warming events of the Northern Hemisphere winters of 2006 and 2009.",,eng,naver

Feelings of loneliness are hypothesized to have implications for physiological stress processes, including activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In a community sample of young adults, multilevel modeling was used to examine whether trait and state feelings of loneliness were related to changes in levels of the stress-sensitive hormone cortisol, and whether the associations between loneliness and cortisol were mediated or moderated by the presence of concurrent depression or high levels of chronic life stress. Results indicated that trait loneliness was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. In addition, both daily and momentary state variations in loneliness were related to cortisol. Prior day feelings of loneliness were associated with an increased cortisol awakening response the next morning and momentary experiences of loneliness during the day were associated with momentary increases in cortisol among youth who also had high chronic interpersonal stress. Results were significant after covarying current depression, both chronic and momentary reports of stress, and medical and lifestyle covariates.
