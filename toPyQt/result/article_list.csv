The important functions of the facilities are surface flow reduction, contaminants elimination and aquifer recharge resulting from filtration, retention and infiltration of stormwater by porous media. A major obstacle in operating infiltration facilities is clogging. Filters of porous media in the facility are clogged by deposition of sediment over time. Clogging reduces infiltration rate and lifespan of the facility. Clogging, thus, needs to be considered as one of the important design factors in constructing infiltration facilities. In this study, 3 clogging models were chosen to simulate clogging, which developed in different disciplines, environmental and geotechnical engineering. Since the models were developed initially for fine media, applicability to coarse media interested in this study needed to be examined. To examine the applicability of models, analytical procedures of models were thoroughly reviewed. Parametric studies were also conducted to determine appropriate input parameters. Finally, the models represented relatively appropriate applicability to estimate clogging developed in an artificial infiltration as well as a real infiltration testing conditions. Although further studies are still needed for considerable aspects in input parameters and equations, the models could be suggested as effective analytical tools to estimate clogging developed in infiltration facilities of urban stormwater.","","","eng","naver"

However, it has been difficult to fabricate thin and dense Pd-based membranes on a porous stainless steel(PSS) support. In case of a conventional PSS support having the large size of surface pores, it was required to use complex surface treatment and thick Pd coating more than $6{\mu}m$ on the PSS was required in order to form pore free surface. In this study, we could fabricate thin and dense Pd membrane with only $3{\mu}m$ Pd layer on a new PSS support manufactured by metal injection molding(MIM). The PSS support had low surface roughness and mean pore size of $5{\mu}m$. Pd membrane were prepared by advanced Pd sputter deposition on the modified PSS support using fine polishing and YSZ vacuum filling surface treatment. At temperature $400^{\circ}C$ and transmembrane pressure difference of 1 bar, hydrogen flux and selectivity of $H_2/N_2$ were $11.22ml\;cm^{-2}min^{-1}$ and infinity, respectively. Comparing with $6{\mu}m$ Pd membrane, $3{\mu}m$ Pd membrane showed 2.5 times higher hydrogen flux which could be due to the decreased Pd layer thickness from $6{\mu}m$ to $3{\mu}m$ and an increased porosity. It was also found that pressure exponent was changed from 0.5 on $6{\mu}m$ Pd membrane to 0.8 on $3{\mu}m$ Pd membrane.","73b04a89f92049e3b0d2c13407ff28b7","","eng","naver"

Methods: NaCl aerosols were generated using an atomizer and passed through cloth masks in a dynamic aerosol chamber. Particle concentrations were measured both before and after for the cloth masks using an optical particle counter (OPC) in the size range of $0.3{\sim}10{\mu}m$. Results: In the original condition, the filtration efficiencies of the five cloth masks were A: 20.1%, B:30.9%, C: 25.0%, D: 26.5%, and E: 40.9%. As the number of washings increased in the order of one, two, and four times, the filtration efficiencies of cloth mask C increased. The filtration efficiency of A, D, and E increased after the first washing. With the exception of B, the filtration efficiency of cloth masks increased after the second washing and those of all cloth masks increased after the fourth washing. This might be caused by the fibers untangling from the yarn and being freed at one end. In this status, the packing density of the textile will not change, but the distances between fibers will increase, which might bring about an increase in filtration efficiency. When the cloth masks were extended by 10% and 20% in one direction, the filtration efficiencies of cloth masks B, D, and E decreased at 10% extension, and those of all cloth masks decreased at 20% extension. When the cloth masks were expanded by 10% and 20% in two directions, the filtration efficiencies of all cloth masks decreased by at least 34.7% at 10% extension, and by at least 60.9% at 20% extension Conclusions: The filtration efficiency of cloth masks could decrease after one to two machine washings, but will increase after four washings in comparison with their original performances. The filtration efficiency of cloth masks will decrease when they are expanded, such as when stretching over the nose during wearing status.","4804f5f66e5e4f95be5b4a4f34ade0ba","","eng","naver"

The lower water activity and storage temperature resulting from this method influenced the survival of L. plantarum. In encapsulated Lactobacillus powders, viability of Lactobacillus was increased during storage at $20^{\circ}C$ relative to that of L. plantarum stored at $35^{\circ}C$ in the same water activity conditions. Furthermore, L. plantarum encapsulated in starch with ginger showed increased viability when compared to non-encapsulated L. plantarum stored without treatment. Finally, based on a simulated digestion test, encapsulated L. plantarum survived at a pH of 2, whereas the non-encapsulated L. plantarum did not. Thus, coating the encapsulated powder with these materials was effective in maintaining Lactobacillus viability.","7e7894e27fc4469f88f768bad52c4fbd","","eng","naver"

P-wave analysis is therefore an important factor in the production of rapid seismic information as it can be used to quickly estimate the earthquake magnitude and epicenter through the amplitude and predominant period of the observed P-wave. However, when a large-magnitude teleseismic earthquake is observed in a local seismic network, the significantly attenuated P wave phases may be mischaracterized as belonging to a small-magnitude local earthquake in the initial analysis stage. Such a misanalysis may be sent to the public as a false alert, reducing the credibility of the EEW system and potentially causing economic losses for infrastructure and industrial facilities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods that reduce misanalysis. In this study, the possibility of seismic misclassifying teleseimic earthquakes as local events was reviewed using the Filter Bank method, which uses the attenuation characteristics of P waves to classify local and outside Korean peninsula (regional and teleseismic) events with filtered waveform depending on frequency and epicenter distance. The data used in our analysis were analyzed for maximum Pv values using 463 events with local magnitudes (2 < ML ≦ 3), 44 (3 < ML ≦ 4), 4 (4 < ML ≦ 5), 3 (ML > 5), and 89 outside Korean peninsula earthquakes recorded by the KMA seismic network.

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","2cc319fee55a439ea21b58ca591ad3de","","eng","naver"

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","4386bf8d285848a3b25fc7b0a0e5ab12","","eng","naver"

As an effort to reduce these problems of dust scattering, we have fabricated SiC composites by employing Si vapor infiltration method into the pores of graphites. In order to understand the diffusion process of the Si vapor infiltration, Si and C atomic percentages of fabricated SiC composites are carefully measured and the diffusion law is used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of Si vapor. A quadratic equation is obtained from the experimental results using the least square method. Diffusion coefficient of Si vapor is estimated using this quadratic equation. The result shows that the diffusion length obtained through the Si vapor infiltration method is about 10.7 times longer than that obtained using liquid Si and clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the present method.","456fd310ef6c486880c346bc5adf4cbd","","eng","naver"

The effectiveness of natural powders varied depending on the surface but, in general, squid ink powder performed well on most surfaces. Indigo powder performed well on tile surfaces, while rice powder performed well on glass surfaces. Plastic was the most difficult surface from which to develop fingerprints.

Conventional studies of nondestructive evaluation have been made for detecting generation of thermally grown oxide (TGO) or qualitatively evaluating delamination in TBC. In this study, the ultrasonic C-scan method was developed to obtain the damage map inside TBC by estimating the delamination in a quantitative way. All specimens were isothermally degraded at $1,100^{\circ}C$ with different time, having different partial delamination area.

The coatings are for LEDs that operate at multiple UV wavelengths, unlike conventional single-wavelength UV-LEDs. Using UV-LED light sources with wavelengths of 365, 395, 420, and 450 nm, we analyzed the optical characteristics such as the direction of light flux and light source. We also analyzed the curing characteristics at each UV-LED wavelength to optimize the LED for composite wavelengths. The curing performance state was predicted through computer simulation for when the multiple wavelengths of UV light sources are superimposed, and then actual LEDs were designed and fabricated. To improve the internal high-speed curing, a multi-spot module was fabricated, in which each LED is condensed, and multiple wavelengths are synthesized and condensed at the same position. The adhesive strength, surface hardness, and internal hardness of the curing agent were tested by varying the wavelength combination conditions. The surface hardening and internal hardening were compared and analyzed using a hardness tester and FT-IR analyzer. As a result, the characteristics of the surface and internal hardness were improved by a multi-spot method in which four wavelengths were overlapped in a UV-LED rather than a single wavelength.","ca999db8431c48fab2861262ec6490db","","eng","naver"

Conventional studies of nondestructive evaluation have been made for detecting generation of thermally grown oxide (TGO) or qualitatively evaluating delamination in TBC. In this study, the ultrasonic C-scan method was developed to obtain the damage map inside TBC by estimating the delamination in a quantitative way. All specimens were isothermally degraded at $1,100^{\circ}C$ with different time, having different partial delamination area. To detect partial delamination in TBC, the C-scan was performed by a single transducer using pulse-echo method with normal incidence. Partial delamination coefficients of 1 mm to 6 mm were derived by the proportion of the surface reflection signal and flaw signal which were theoretical signals using Rogers-Van Buren and Kim's equations. Using the partial delamination coefficients, the partial delamination maps were obtained. Regardless of the partial delamination coefficient, partial delamination area was increased when degradation time was increased in TBC. In addition, a decrease in partial delamination area in each TBC specimen was observed when the partial delamination coefficient was increased.

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage.

In this paper, the author reviews the current research on the retrieval of vertical air motions using the cloud radar. At radar wavelengths of 3 mm (W-band radar; 94-GHz radar; cloud radar), the raindrop backscattering cross-section (${\sigma}b$) varies between successive maxima and minima as a function of the raindrop diameter (D) that are well described by Mie theory. The first Mie minimum in the backscattering cross-section occurs at D~1.68 mm, which translates to a raindrop terminal fall velocity of ${\sim}5.85m\;s^{-1}$ based on the Gunn and Kinzer relationship. Since raindrop diameters often exceed this size, the signal is captured in the radar Doppler spectrum, and thus, the location of the first Mie minimum can be used as a reference for retrieving the vertical air motion. The Mie technique is applied to radar Doppler spectra from the surface-based and airborne, upward pointing W-band radars. The contributions of aircraft motion to the vertical air motion are also described and further the first-order aircraft motion corrected equation is presented. The review also shows that the separate spectral peaks due to the cloud droplets can provide independent validation of the Mie technique retrieved vertical air motion using the cloud droplets as a tracer of vertical air motion.","4d3c27a1e6b9410d85267357cbd4f90f","","eng","naver"

Since flood causes a lot of damages, flooded area should be distinguished from non flooded area. Also, the detection of flood area should be accurate. Therefore, not only image resolution but also the filtering process is critical to minimize resolution degradation. Although a resolution of radar images become better as technology develops, there were a limited focused on a highly suitable filtering methods for flood detection. Thus, the purpose of this study is to find out the most appropriate filtering method for flood detection by comparing three filtering methods: Lee filter, Frost filter and NL-means filter. Therefore, to compare the filters to detect floods, each filters are applied to the radar image. Comparison was drawn among filtered images. Then, the flood map, results of filtered images are compared in that order. As a result, Frost and NL-means filter are more effective in removing the speckle noise compared to Lee filter. In case of Frost filter, resolution degradation occurred severly during removal of the noise. In case of NL-means filter, shadow effect which could be one of the main reasons that causes false detection were not eliminated comparing to other filters. Nevertheless, result of NL-means filter shows the best detection rate because the number of shadow pixels is relatively low in entire image.

When a high speed train enters a tunnel, aerodynamic resistance is generated suddenly. This resistance causes micro pressure wave and discomfort to passengers. Due to this aerodynamic pressure against the train, a large amount of traction is required for the operation of a train in a tunnel. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate a pressure relief system in a tunnel in order to reduce aerodynamic resistance caused by a high-speed train.

For a better understanding of the metal removal mechanisms, batch experiments were performed using soil calcined at $850^{\circ}C$ under various pH conditions for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Cr. The results showed that the metal removal efficiency with the exception of Cr decreased abruptly, even within 5 min, showing more than 90% removal. The pH of each reactant increased gradually from around 7 to 9 with time. The increases in metal removal at higher pH appear to be associated with metal hydroxides precipitation. Comparative experiments, which were carried out changing the pH by reacting with commercial activated carbon (CAC), natural yellow soil (NYS), and calcined yellow soil (CYS), showed that the pH of the CYS only increased with time. Calcination processes might lead to a change in the physical properties of the soil matrix resulting in a high pH when reacted with water.

In most cases, the reason that detail preservation is prior to take over tone mapping is that the dynamic range is significantly different between input and output images. In the case of iCAM06, details are separated by using a bilateral filter, however, it causes noise amplification at the dim surround region. Thus, we suggest that the detail signal, which is separated from the bilateral filter, is combined with the base signal after an adaptive Kalman filter is applied according to the local standard deviation.

The performance of a humidifying element is commonly expressed as humidification efficiency, which is used independent of air temperature, humidity and water temperature. In this study, a series of tests were conducted at two air conditions (data center and commercial building) using two different humidifying elements (cellulose/PET and Glasdek) changing the frontal air velocity and water temperature. Results showed that the measured humidification efficiency was dependent on the air condition and water temperature. In fact, even dehumidification occurred at the inlet of the humidifying element at the air condition of commercial building. The reason was due to the inlet water temperature, which was lower than the dew point air temperature. As the difference between the inlet water and the dew point air temperature increased, the humidification efficiency decreased. This suggest that proper thermal model should account for the inlet region, where the amount of moisture transfer may be different from the other part of the humidification element. A simple analysis on the thermal performance of the cellulose/PET humidification element showed that the Sherwood number was adequately predicted, whereas the friction factor was ovepredicted, probably due to the simplification of the channel geometry and the neglection of the water film on the element surface.","b4324b64ec81491998029e62db4bc125","","eng","naver"

The effectiveness of natural powders varied depending on the surface but, in general, squid ink powder performed well on most surfaces. Indigo powder performed well on tile surfaces, while rice powder performed well on glass surfaces. Plastic was the most difficult surface from which to develop fingerprints. Image analysis using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) demonstrated the importance of the size and shape of natural powder particles to properly adhere to the ridges.

We have studied the surface characteristics according to the materials for the two typical printing methods: The most commonly used method of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing and the relatively high resolution method of Stereolithography (SLA) printing. The FDM prints exhibited hydrophilic properties before post - treatment, regardless of the material, but showed hydrophobic properties after post - treatment with acetone vapor. It was confirmed by the observation of surface roughness using SEM that the change of the contact angle was due to the removal of the surface structure by post-treatment. SLA prints exhibited hydrophilic properties compared to FDM prints, but they were experimentally confirmed to be capable of surface modification using hydrophobic coatings. It was confirmed that it is impossible to make a transparent specimen in the FDM method. However, sufficient transparency is secured in the case of the SLA method. It is also confirmed that the electroporation chip of the digital electroporation system based on the droplet contact charging phenomenon was fabricated by the SLA method and the direct application to the microfluidic system by demonstrating the electroporation successfully.","3c246c61c2a841e990cda054be7710ee","","eng","naver"

The solutions were spin-coated on a cold-rolled steel sheet and cured thermally to prepare water repellent coating films. During this process, the effect of molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was studied for the hydrophobic properties of the coating films. Hydrophobic properties of coating films were characterized using contact angle measurement, surface morphology analysis and infrared spectroscopy. When the molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was varied from 0 to 30, the contact angle of the un-coated cold-rolled steel sheet was $30^{\circ}$, whereas when the molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was 1, the contact angle increased to $104^{\circ}$ and water repellency was significantly improved.

At this time, the hydrophobicity of the coating films was improved by the increase of the surface roughness and the content of the methyl component at the coating surface. In particular, when the molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was 30, the overall surface roughness was greatly increased due to the presence of surface particles as well as the water repellency due to methyl groups of TMES, resulting in super hydrophobicity of $144^{\circ}$.","43fd17ccc0e4497fac530dd710266d21","","eng","naver"

Hydrophobic properties of coating films were characterized using contact angle measurement, surface morphology analysis and infrared spectroscopy. When the molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was varied from 0 to 30, the contact angle of the un-coated cold-rolled steel sheet was $30^{\circ}$, whereas when the molar ratio of TMES/MTMS was 1, the contact angle increased to $104^{\circ}$ and water repellency was significantly improved.

In this paper, the author reviews the current research on the retrieval of vertical air motions using the cloud radar. At radar wavelengths of 3 mm (W-band radar; 94-GHz radar; cloud radar), the raindrop backscattering cross-section (${\sigma}b$) varies between successive maxima and minima as a function of the raindrop diameter (D) that are well described by Mie theory. The first Mie minimum in the backscattering cross-section occurs at D~1.68 mm, which translates to a raindrop terminal fall velocity of ${\sim}5.85m\;s^{-1}$ based on the Gunn and Kinzer relationship. Since raindrop diameters often exceed this size, the signal is captured in the radar Doppler spectrum, and thus, the location of the first Mie minimum can be used as a reference for retrieving the vertical air motion. The Mie technique is applied to radar Doppler spectra from the surface-based and airborne, upward pointing W-band radars. The contributions of aircraft motion to the vertical air motion are also described and further the first-order aircraft motion corrected equation is presented. The review also shows that the separate spectral peaks due to the cloud droplets can provide independent validation of the Mie technique retrieved vertical air motion using the cloud droplets as a tracer of vertical air motion.","61075bf3bbd247d8ac71a309642af763","","eng","naver"

The performance of a humidifying element is commonly expressed as humidification efficiency, which is used independent of air temperature, humidity and water temperature. In this study, a series of tests were conducted at two air conditions (data center and commercial building) using two different humidifying elements (cellulose/PET and Glasdek) changing the frontal air velocity and water temperature. Results showed that the measured humidification efficiency was dependent on the air condition and water temperature. In fact, even dehumidification occurred at the inlet of the humidifying element at the air condition of commercial building. The reason was due to the inlet water temperature, which was lower than the dew point air temperature. As the difference between the inlet water and the dew point air temperature increased, the humidification efficiency decreased. This suggest that proper thermal model should account for the inlet region, where the amount of moisture transfer may be different from the other part of the humidification element. A simple analysis on the thermal performance of the cellulose/PET humidification element showed that the Sherwood number was adequately predicted, whereas the friction factor was ovepredicted, probably due to the simplification of the channel geometry and the neglection of the water film on the element surface.","ec6a49a82e00430098c0ee0f2c56b55e","","eng","naver"

However, since they are driven by the electric power from batteries, the distance they can travel based on a single charge depends on their energy density. Therefore, the lithium-ion battery having a high energy density is a good candidate for the batteries of electric vehicles. Since the electrode is an essential component that governs their efficiency, the electrode manufacturing process plays a vital role in the entire production process of lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the coating process is a critical step in the manufacturing of the electrode, which has a significant influence on its performance.

In order to address this problem, a number of en-route filtering schemes has been proposed. Notably, a dynamic en-route filtering scheme can save energy by filtering of the false report. In the key dissemination phase of the existing scheme, the nodes closer to the source node may not have matching keys to detect the false report.

Iron (Fe) associated with sediment in contact with groundwater and infiltrating surface water is an important factor in determining the quality of water recovered from the pumping wells in river bank filtration. This study reports the results of Fe speciation in the aquifer sediment samples collected from different depths at the river bank filtration site in Changwon, studied using four different chemical extraction methods, namely, ferrozine, oxalate, HCl, and DCB methods. Overall, the results show that Fe(II) as well as the total Fe content decreases with depth down to ~20 m and then increases further below. This trend is consistent with the redox characteristics suggested by visual observation. The silt/clay size fraction (${\phi}$ < 62.5 ${\mu}M$) has up to 2~10 times more Fe compared with the sand size fraction (62.5 ${\mu}M$ < ${\phi}$ < 2 mm), depending on the extraction method.

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed filter algorithm, we used PSNR(peak signal to noise ratio) and compared existing methods and proposed filter algorithm in the mixed noise environment with Gaussian noise, impulsive noise, and two noises mixed.","a28d1ebb4d6f4cf2bed2d9b70008be5c","","eng","naver"

In this study, Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) technique was applied for sludge solubilization and the performance was evaluated. The PEF equipped with electrodes coated by epoxy resin and teflon was inducted to the activated sludge suspension, and the effect of the coating materials on the solubilization was determined. In addition, the effect of the applied voltage on the solubilization yield was investigated as the applied voltage was increased from 6 to 12 and 15 kV. Sludge solubilization was not observed when the epoxy-coated electrode was used for PEF induction regardless of the applied voltage. However, sludge solubilization occurred when 12 and 15 kV were applied to the teflon-coated electrodes. The MLSS decreased to 9%, and the soluble-COD increased to 496% when the applied voltage was 15 kV. But sludge solubilization did not happen under 6 kV condition. The corona discharge was observed at applied voltages of 12 and 15 kV, (Ed- sorry but I cannot understand the following highlight) but if 6 kV, strongly indicating that the corona discharge make the sludge solubilized, which suggests that the critical voltage for sludge solubilization lies between 6 and 12 kV.

However, since they are driven by the electric power from batteries, the distance they can travel based on a single charge depends on their energy density. Therefore, the lithium-ion battery having a high energy density is a good candidate for the batteries of electric vehicles. Since the electrode is an essential component that governs their efficiency, the electrode manufacturing process plays a vital role in the entire production process of lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the coating process is a critical step in the manufacturing of the electrode, which has a significant influence on its performance. In this paper, we propose an innovative process for improving the efficiency and productivity of the coating process in electrode manufacturing and describe the equipment design method and development results. Specifically, we propose a design procedure and development method in order to improve the core plate coating quality by 25%, using a technology capable of reducing the assembly margin due to its high output/high capacity and improving the product capacity quality and assembly process yield. Using this method, the battery life of the lithium-ion battery cell was improved. Compared with the existing coating process, the target loading level is maintained and dispersed to maintain the anode capacity (${\pm}0.4{\rightarrow}{\pm}0.3mg/cm^2r$ reduction).","3a60d839f784421a9f7213426502f72e","","eng","naver"

A ball-on-disc wear tests in the mold steel and a dicing tests in the micro-diamond blades were conducted to understand degradation of DLC coatings.

If someone in this temporary shelter is infected with an airborne infectious disease, it becomes easier for the disease to spread to the other people in the shelter than it would be under normal conditions. Therefore, temporary shelters need to provide not only water and food but also hygienic indoor conditions. Methods : In this study, the use of mechanical systems such as ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems and air cleaners were simulated using numerical analysis to find out how these systems can control airborne infection in temporary shelters.

Directshow is a media framework which makes the development of such multimedia software simple, quick and regular process. In the Directshow, data are processed through the connections between filters. In general, Filtergraph is utilized to be set as 'Intelligent Connection' for filter connection. However, when we use this 'Intelligent Connection' option, they can show non-expected results or fail to connect with filter's pins together. So in this paper, we propose non-necessary filter cut-off method for connecting only just wanted filters. There are two methods such as inner filter cut-off method and outer filter one. The inner filter cut-off method is good at connection's compatibility and able to quickly connect with each other filter. But in the outer filter cut-off method, filter source is not necessary and connection is exactly done with other filter. In the end, we propose Directshow based filter cut-off model which compose of wanted filter connection and minimize error probability, through mixing up the advantages of two filter cut-off methods.","e0eddf3d5f5647f4a489a4cff47a06bd","","eng","naver"

So we designed a band-stop filter that combines the electrically coupled open stub (ECOS) band-stop filter with a symmetric dual spurline. We can greatly extend the stopband, when it is combined with the dual spurline and electrically coupled open stub on a microstrip transmission line, without any size increment.

The temperature reached to thermophilic phase within 2 days and it was maintained up to the $5^{th}$ day of the composting process in all reactors and then gradually decreased to room temperature at the end of the composting process. The moisture content (MC, %) of the initial mixtures was 64.27%, and it was reduced to 38.4, 33.08, 14.59 and 11.93 in the different suction rate of 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, respectively in the end process. During the composting, the level of pH was increased from 6.83 to 8.67 and it gradually decreased to 7.56 in 100% and 200%(SR). At the same time, the pH values were reduced only up to 8.19 at 300%, and 8.08 at 400%(SR), showing that suction strengths of 100% and 200% were the better option for composting than those of 300% and 400%.

Compared with the galling frequency of the 304 STS fasteners, Sn-Al coatings on the surface of 304 STS fasteners demonstrated about 2.8-time reduction of the galling frequency.","ce3a20f1bf434c7ca608c5323c2ca837","","eng","naver"

It is possible to obtain a clear image by amplifying the light in the presence of a certain amount of weak light. However, in an extremely low-light environment, where even moonlight is not present, there is not enough light to amplify anything, and the sharpness of the screen deteriorates. In this paper, a method is proposed to improve image quality by using multiple filters and anisotropic diffusion for output noise of the image-intensifying device in extreme low-light environments. For the experiment, the output of the image-intensifying device was obtained under extremely low-light conditions, and signal processing for improving the image quality was performed. The configuration of the filters for signal processing uses anisotropic diffusion after applying a median filter and a Wiener filter for effective removal of salt-and-pepper noise and Gaussian noise, which constitute the main noise appearing in the image. Experimental results show that the improvement visually enhanced image quality. Both peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and SSIM, which are quantitative indicators, show improved values.","6092e08014ea4193939cbb34030be6aa","","eng","naver"

The formation mechanisms including structural, morphological, and chemical bonding properties are demonstrated by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To investigate the optimum amount of the Ru nanoparticles decorated on the porous CNFs, we controlled three different weight ratios (0 wt%, 20 wt%, and 40 wt%) of the Ru nanoparticles on the porous CNFs. For the case of 20 wt% Ru nanoparticles decorated on the porous CNFs, TEM results indicate that the Ru nanoparticles with ~2-4 nm size are uniformly distributed on the porous CNFs. In addition, 40 wt% Ru nanoparticles decorated on the porous CNFs exhibit agglomerated Ru nanoparticles, which causes low performance of electrodes in electrochemical capacitors. Thus, proper distribution of 20 wt% Ru nanoparticles decorated on the porous CNFs presents superior specific capacitance (~280.5 F/g at 10 mV/s) as compared to the 40 wt% Ru nanoparticles decorated on the porous CNFs and the only porous CNFs. This enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effects of well-distributed Ru nanoparticles and porous CNF supports having high surface area.","58e43b87aade4e3d9c2a2f9915d94bed","","eng","naver"

Recently, geosmin and 2-MIB are detected frequently at abnormally high concentration level. However, conventional water treatment without advanced water treatment processes such as adsorption and oxidation process, cannot remove these two compounds efficiently. Moreover, it is known that the advanced treatment processes i.e. adsorption and oxidation have also several limits to the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB. Therefore, the purpose of this study was not only to evaluate full scale nanofiltration membrane system with $300m^3/day$ of permeate capacity and 90% of recovery on the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB in spiked natural raw water sources at high feed concentration with a range of approximately 500 to 2,500 ng/L, but also to observe rejection property of the compounds within multi stage NF membrane system. Rejection rate of geosmin and 2-MIB by NF membrane process was 96% that is 4% of passage regardless of the feed water concentration which indicates NF membrane system with an operational values suggested in this research can be employed in drinking water treatment plant to control geosmin and 2-MIB of high concentration. But, according to results of regression analysis in this study it is recommended that feed water concentration of geosmin and 2-MIB would not exceed 220 and 300 ng/L respectively which is not to be perceived in drinking tap water. Also it suggests that the removal rate might be depended on an operating conditions such as feed water characteristics and membrane flux. When each stage of NF membrane system was evaluated relatively higher removal rate was observed at the conditions that is lower flux, higher DOC and TDS, i.e., $2^{nd}$ stage NF membrane systems, possibly due to an interaction mechanisms between compounds and cake layer on the membrane surfaces.","be9231fc84f34763bef12fb5dc54afb7","","eng","naver"

The attempt was made to optimize the reaction conditions for an efficient derivatization reaction, and TLC images taken by a digital camera were analyzed using two types of image analysis program (CP Atlas 2.0 and ImageJ) for repeatability (RSD, %) and linearity (R2). Then, their results were compared. For efficient derivatization, the reaction conditions needed to be modified. The results of image analysis of each of the samples at two different concentrations (0.5 mg/mL and 0.01 mg/mL) showed that the RSD values for reaction repeatability were in the range of 0.69-5.50%. From the calibration curves between the area of the derivative and the concentration of amines, the R2 values (R2 > 0.9906) for good linear correlation were found to be high, in a concentration range of 0.1-0.005 mg/mL of amines.

If someone in this temporary shelter is infected with an airborne infectious disease, it becomes easier for the disease to spread to the other people in the shelter than it would be under normal conditions. Therefore, temporary shelters need to provide not only water and food but also hygienic indoor conditions. Methods : In this study, the use of mechanical systems such as ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems and air cleaners were simulated using numerical analysis to find out how these systems can control airborne infection in temporary shelters. An indoor gymnasium was selected as a temporary shelter for the numerical simulation model considering Korea's post-disaster response system. Influenza A virus was assumed as an airborne infectious disease and the diffusion of the virus was made by one person in the shelter. Results : The result of this study showed that the UVGI systems disinfected the virus more effectively than the air cleaners by creating a more stable airflow after the disinfection process. The air cleaners could remove the virus but since it created an unstable airflow in the temporary shelter, the virus was condensed to a certain area to show a higher virus concentration level than the source location. Implications : In the temporary shelter, it is necessary to use UVGI systems or air cleaners for hygienic indoor conditions.","cd689a800f974db1b5e2d10038f04b56","","eng","naver"

Methods: We selected a new office building located in Sejong-si and occupants who work in the Office for study. The indoor air pollutant was investigated according to applying indoor plants. The indoor air quality of the new building was evaluated by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aldehydes, temperature and humidity. The level of dry eye symptoms was classified into normal, mild, moderate and severe by using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). Results: There was VOCs' reduction effect according to placing indoor plants because the concentration of VOCs in newly-built government office (Sejong-si) was highly decreased when the indoor plants was placed at the office. The occupants' SBS (Sick Building Syndrome) symptoms score was gradually decreased in accordance with applying indoor plants. However, SBS symptoms score was increased when the office was not applied indoor plants. There was not statistical significance in workers' dry eye questionnaire results. Conclusions: There was reduction effect of indoor air pollutant in applied indoor plants office. Also, in case of questionnaire results of ophthalmoxerosis and SBS (Sick Building Syndrome) symptoms score were showed positive effect.

The population-based forward selection method was applied to select an informative subset of descriptors of learning algorithms, such as by using multiple linear regression (MLR) and the support vector machine (SVM) method. Each individual model and consensus model was evaluated by internal validation using the bootstrap method and y-randomization. The predictions of the performance of the external test set were improved by considering their applicability to the domain.

AOD was relatively high in March ($0.44{\pm}0.25$) and low in September ($0.24{\pm}0.21$) in the East Asian region in 2009. Sandstorms originating from the deserts and dry areas in Northern China and Mongolia were transported on a massive scale during the springtime, thus contributing to the high AOD in East Asia. Although $PM_{10}$ with diameters ${\leq}10{\mu}m$ was the highest in February at Anmyon, Cheongwon and Ulleung, which is located leeward about half-way through the Korean Peninsula, AOD rose to a high in May. The growth of hygroscopic aerosols moving with increases in relative humidity prior to the Asian monsoon season contributed to a high AOD level in May. AE typically reaches its highest value ($1.30{\pm}0.37$) in August due to anthropogenic aerosols originating from industrial areas in Eastern China, while AOD stays low in summer due to the removal process caused by rainfall. The linear correlation coefficients of the MODIS AOD and ground-based mass concentrations of $PM_{10}$ at Anmyon, Cheongwon and Ulleung were 0.4-0.6. Four cases (six days) of mineral dustfall from sandstorms and six cases (twelve days) of anthropogenically polluted particles were observed in the central area of the Korean Peninsula in 2009. $PM_{10}$ mass concentrations increased at both Anmyon and Cheongwon in the cases of mineral dustfall and anthropogenically polluted particles.

Ninety-eight compounds consisting of 9 aliphatic hydrocarbons, 17 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 11 aliphatic aldehydes, 1 terpene aldehyde, 8 aliphatic alcohols, 4 monoterpene alcohols, 16 sesquiterpene alcohols, 3 diterpene alcohols, 6 ketones, 11 esters, 8 oxides and epoxides, 3 acids and 1 miscellaneous one were identified from the oil. Spathulenol (22.33%) was the most abundant compound, followed by ${\beta}$- caryophyllene (6.23%), germacrene D (5.57%), longipinane (4.10%), and epiglobulol (3.65%). The volatile composition of Syneilesis palmata was characterized by higher contents of sesquiterpene compounds, especially sesquiterpene alcohols. The total content of 13 sesquiterpene compounds was decreased significantly from 2010 to 2012. ${\alpha}$-Caryophyllene, ${\beta}$-bisabolene, elemol, germacrene D, ${\beta}$-zingiberene, longipinane, and ${\beta}$-caryophyllene alcohol contents decreased, while ${\beta}$-bisabolol content increased during 3 years. The ecological responses to recent climate change may be influenced in the chemical components of natural plant terpenoids.","a4cb5ac5bf904f5cbabd2bce9832fc7a","","eng","naver"

Repression of pci2 expression inhibited both growth and mRNA export. And over-expression of pci2 also exhibited growth retardation with slight accumulation of $poly(A)^+$ RNA in the nucleus. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the Pci2 protein physically interacted with Sac3 and Dss1, which are members of TREX-2 complex.

So array shape estimation methods are needed. Typically the method based on Kalman filter using heading sensor is used. In practice, the measurement is corrupted by biases which are caused by rotation of the tow cable, varying magnetic fields and slowly varying stresses in the mechanical construction. Although they can't be calibrated but can be estimated.

However, objective and unbiased evaluation methods that would compare the fingerprints with diverse available and developing methods are currently lacking. To develop an objective and quantitative method to improve fingerprint evaluation, a preliminary study was performed to extract useful research information from the analysis with densitometric image analysis (CP Atlas 2.0) and the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for the developed fingerprints on porous surfaces. First, inked fingerprints obtained by varying pressure (kg.f) and pressing time (sec.) to find optimal conditions for obtaining fingerprint samples were analyzed, because they could provide fingerprints of a relatively uniform quality. The extracted number of minutiae from the analysis with AFIS was compared with the calculated areas of friction ridge peaks from the image analysis. Inked fingerprints with a pressing pressure of 1.0 kg.f for 5 seconds provided the most visually clear fingerprints, the highest number of minutiae points, and the largest average area of the peaks of the friction ridge. In addition, the images of the developed latent fingerprints on thermal paper with the iodine fuming method were analyzed. Fingerprinting condition of 1.0 kg.f/5 sec was also found to be optimal when generating highest minutiae number and the largest average area of peaks of ridges. Additionally, when the concentration of ninhydrin solution (0.5 % vs. 5 %) was used to compare the developed latent fingerprints on print paper, the best fingerprinting condition was 2.0 kg.f/5 sec and 5 % of ninhydrin concentration. It was confirmed that the larger the average area of the peaks generated by the image analysis, the higher the number of minutiae points was found. With additional tests for fingerprint evaluation using the densitometric image analysis, this method can prove to be a new quantitative and objective assessment method for fingerprint development.","9b93437814b244269e901df0fdc28d46","","eng","naver"

The obtained 180 pressure drop test data were used to predict pressure drop with multiple regression model so that pressure drop data can be used for effective operation condition and as basic data for economical design. The prediction results showed that when filtration velocity was increased by 1%, pressure drop was increased by 2.2% which indicated that filtration velocity among operation condition was attributed on the pressure drop the most. Pressure was dropped by 1.53% when pulse pressure was increased by 1% which also confirmed that pulse pressure was the major factor affecting on the pressure drop next to filtration velocity. Meanwhile, pressure drops were found increased by 0.3% and 0.37%, respectively when inlet dust concentration and pulse interval were increased by 1% implying that the effects of inlet dust concentration and pulse interval were less as compared with those changes of filtration velocity and pulse pressure. Therefore, the larger effect on the pressure drop the pulse jet bag filter was found in the order of filtration velocity($V_f$), pulse pressure($P_p$), inlet dust concentration($C_i$), pulse interval($P_i$). Also, the prediction result of filtration velocity, inlet dust concentration, pulse pressure, and pulse interval which showed the largest effect on the pressure drop indicated that stable operation can be executed with filtration velocity less than 1.5 m/min and inlet dust concentration less than $4g/m^3$. However, it was regarded that pulse pressure and pulse interval need to be adjusted when inlet dust concentration is higher than $4g/m^3$. When filtration velocity and pulse pressure were examined, operation was possible regardless of changes in pulse pressure if filtration velocity was at 1.5 m/min. If filtration velocity was increased to 2 m/min. operation would be possible only when pulse pressure was set at higher than $5.8kgf/cm^2$. Also, the prediction result of pressure drop with filtration velocity and pulse interval showed that operation with pulse interval less than 50 sec. should be carried out under filtration velocity at 1.5 m/min. While, pulse interval should be set at lower than 11 sec. if filtration velocity was set at 2 m/min.

It is possible to obtain a clear image by amplifying the light in the presence of a certain amount of weak light. However, in an extremely low-light environment, where even moonlight is not present, there is not enough light to amplify anything, and the sharpness of the screen deteriorates.

For the experiment, the output of the image-intensifying device was obtained under extremely low-light conditions, and signal processing for improving the image quality was performed. The configuration of the filters for signal processing uses anisotropic diffusion after applying a median filter and a Wiener filter for effective removal of salt-and-pepper noise and Gaussian noise, which constitute the main noise appearing in the image. Experimental results show that the improvement visually enhanced image quality.

Risk management is applicable to various fields, since it can manage the cost/schedule and effectively guides accomplishing the target performance by identifying and managing the risks in advance, which necessitates many concurrent studies. This paper proposes a procedure to estimate the severity value for a risk item using a Kalman filter. It is assumed that the severity can be expressed as an equation consisting of cost/schedule loss during the risk event. A linear Kalman filter is used to reduce the error between the true and estimated values, which can eventually save resources spent on the risk management procedure.

Flotation using $CO_2$ as an alternative to air could be effective in overcoming the high power consumption in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process. The comparison of DAF and DCF system indicated that, the carbon dioxide flotation (DCF) system with pressurized $CO_2$ only requires 1.5 ~ 2.0 atm, while the DAF system requires 3.0 ~ 6.0 atm.

In addition, laboratory experiments were sequentially done to verify the simulation results of the SCC model. Based on the simulation results, surfactant injection, which is known to decrease bubble size, cloud improved the collision efficiency of $CO_2$ bubbles similar to that of air bubbles.

To cultivate metal-reducing bacteria from groundwater sampled at the KURT in S. Korea, different electron donors such as glucose, acetate, lactate, formate, pyruvate and Fe(III)-citrate as an electron accepter were added into growth media. The enriched culture was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for the diversity of microbial species. The effect of electron donors (i.e., glucose, acetate, lactate, formate, pyruvate) and electron acceptors (i.e., akaganeite, manganese oxide) on microbial iron/manganese reduction and biomineralization were examined using the 1st enriched culture, respectively. SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses were used to determine morphological features, chemical composition of microbes and mineralogical characteristics of the iron and manganese minerals. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the four species, Fusibacter, Desulfuromonas, Actinobacteria, Pseudomonas sp., from KURT groundwater were identified as anaerobic metal reducers and these microbes precipitated metals outside of cells in common. XRD and EDX analyses showed that Fe(III)-containing mineral, akaganeite (${\beta}$-FeOOH), reduced into Fe(II)/Fe(III)-containing magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$) and Mn(IV)-containing manganese oxide (${\lambda}-MnO_2$) into Mn(II)-containing rhodochrosite ($MnCO_3$) by the microbes. These results implicate that microbial metabolism and respiratory activities under anaerobic condition result in reduction and biomineralization of iron and manganese minerals.

The effect of types of catalysts and solvents on the water repellency of the resulting coating films was investigated during this process. When hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are strong acids, were used as catalysts, the solutions showed a white opaque state due to the aggregation of siloxane polymers. On the other hand, when acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and oxalic acid, which are weak acids, were used, they were in a stable and transparent state without precipitation. As a result, the contact angles of the coated films, prepared from hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, were $58^{\circ}$ and $92^{\circ}$, respectively, showing low water repellency. On the other hand, when acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and oxalic acid were used, the contact angles of the coated films were $101^{\circ}$, $103^{\circ}$ and $116^{\circ}$, respectively, showing high water repellency. In addition, when isopropanol and ethanol were used as solvents, phase separation occurred in the solutions due to the aggregation of siloxane polymers.

Methods: Personal samples for students were measured using passive samplers(OVM 3500) during three kinds of practice, including polish nail, gel nail and acrylic French sculpture at two universities located in Gyeongsangbuk-do Province. We also monitored area concentrations using active samplers and real-time total VOC monitors(ppbRAE 3000). All samples were analyzed with a gas chromatography flame ionized detector. Statistical analysis for monitored data were conducted using a web-based Bayesian toolkit, EXPOSTATS(www.expostats.ca). Results: Twenty-four personal samples and ten area samples were collected and five chemicals(acetone, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl methacrylate(EMA) and methyl methacrylate(MMA)) were detected. Acetone was detected in all personal samples and ranged from 2.58 ppm to 50.3 ppm. EMA was detected in all personal and area samples with a maximum concentration of 9.78 ppm during acrylic French sculpture. Personal exposure levels to acetone, butyl acetate and mixtures were significantly higher with high occupant density (p<0.05). Geometric mean (GM) concentrations of 3.61 ppm for EMA personal samples were significantly higher than that of area samples, 1.5 ppm (p<0.05). Since there was no local ventilation, total VOC concentration continued to increase as the practice progressed. Conclusions: In order to minimize VOCs exposure for trainees, it is necessary to introduce a local ventilation system and maintain adequate occupant density.","22f390ce035942b79f68cad83964a07b","","eng","naver"

The silicate-coated rice seed (SCS) was prepared as follows. Naturally infested rice seeds not previously subjected to any fungicidal treatment were dressed with a mixture of 25% silicic acid at pH 11 and 300-mesh zeolite powder at a ratio of 50 g dry seed - 9 mL silicic acid - 25 g zeolite powder. The following nursery conditions were provided : Early sowing, dense seeding in a glass house with mulching overnight and no artificial heating, which were the ideal conditions for determining the effect on the seed. The nursery plants were evaluated for Gibberella. fujikuroi infection or to determine the recovery to normal growth of infected nursery plants in the Wagner pot. Seedlings emerged 2-3 days earlier for the SCS than they did for the non-SCS control, while damping-off and bakanae disease incidence were remarkably reduced. Specifically, bakanae disease incidence in the SCS was limited to only 7.8% for 80 days after sowing, as compared to 91.6% of the non-SCS control. For the 45-days-old SCS nursery seedlings, the fresh weight was increased by 11% and was two times heavier, with only mild damage compared to that observed for non-SCS. Even after transplanting, SCS treatment contributed to a lower incidence of further infections and possibly to recovery of the seedlings to normal growth as compared to that observed in symptomatic plants in the pot. The active pathogenic macro-conidia and micro-conidia were considerably lower in the soil, root, and seedling sheath base of the SCS. In particular, the underdeveloped macro-conidia with straight oblong shape without intact septum were isolated in the SCS ; this phenotype is likely to be at a comparative etiological disadvantage when compared to that of typical active macro-conidia, which are slightly sickle-shaped with 3-7 intact septa. A active intact conidia with high inoculum potential were rarely observed in the tissue of the seedlings treated only in the SCS. We propose that promising result was likely achieved via inhibition of the development of intact pathogenic conidia, in concert with the aerobic, acidic conditions induced by the physiochemical characteristics associated with the air porosity of zeolite, alkalinity of silicate and the seed husk as a carbon source. In addition, the resistance of the healthy plants to pathogenic conidia was also important factor.","e720b8e6bdf2471b80ce6ce2233d1183","","eng","naver"

P-wave analysis is therefore an important factor in the production of rapid seismic information as it can be used to quickly estimate the earthquake magnitude and epicenter through the amplitude and predominant period of the observed P-wave. However, when a large-magnitude teleseismic earthquake is observed in a local seismic network, the significantly attenuated P wave phases may be mischaracterized as belonging to a small-magnitude local earthquake in the initial analysis stage. Such a misanalysis may be sent to the public as a false alert, reducing the credibility of the EEW system and potentially causing economic losses for infrastructure and industrial facilities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods that reduce misanalysis. In this study, the possibility of seismic misclassifying teleseimic earthquakes as local events was reviewed using the Filter Bank method, which uses the attenuation characteristics of P waves to classify local and outside Korean peninsula (regional and teleseismic) events with filtered waveform depending on frequency and epicenter distance. The data used in our analysis were analyzed for maximum Pv values using 463 events with local magnitudes (2 < ML ≦ 3), 44 (3 < ML ≦ 4), 4 (4 < ML ≦ 5), 3 (ML > 5), and 89 outside Korean peninsula earthquakes recorded by the KMA seismic network. The results show that local and telesesimic earthquakes can be classified more accurately when combination of filtering bands of No. 3 (6-12 Hz) and No. 6 (0.75-1.5 Hz) is applied.","7fc749e5cbba41f6a46750b4d64fe73e","","eng","naver"

Flotation using $CO_2$ as an alternative to air could be effective in overcoming the high power consumption in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process. The comparison of DAF and DCF system indicated that, the carbon dioxide flotation (DCF) system with pressurized $CO_2$ only requires 1.5 ~ 2.0 atm, while the DAF system requires 3.0 ~ 6.0 atm.

In addition, laboratory experiments were sequentially done to verify the simulation results of the SCC model. Based on the simulation results, surfactant injection, which is known to decrease bubble size, cloud improved the collision efficiency of $CO_2$ bubbles similar to that of air bubbles.

The IMC growth behaviors of both $Cu_3Sn$ and $(Cu,Ni,Au)_6Sn_5$ follow linear relationship with the square root of the annealing time, which could be understood by the dominant diffusion mechanism. Two IMC phases with slightly different compositions, that is, $(Cu,Au^a)_6Sn_5$ and $(Cu,Au^b)_6Sn_5$ formed at Cu/solder interface after bonding and grew with increased annealing time. By the way, $Cu_3Sn$ and $(Cu,Au^b)_6Sn_5$ phases formed at the interfaces between $(Cu,Ni,Au)_6Sn_5$ and Ni/Sn, respectively, and both grew with increased annealing time. The activation energies for $Cu_3Sn$ and $(Cu,Ni,Au)_6Sn_5$ IMC growths during annealing were 0.69 and 0.84 eV, respectively, where Ni layer seems to serve as diffusion barrier for extensive Cu-Sn IMC formation which is expected to contribute to the improvement of electrical reliability of micro-bump.","697826e4fef74f99888a1515060fb376","","eng","naver"

In most cases, the reason that detail preservation is prior to take over tone mapping is that the dynamic range is significantly different between input and output images. In the case of iCAM06, details are separated by using a bilateral filter, however, it causes noise amplification at the dim surround region. Thus, we suggest that the detail signal, which is separated from the bilateral filter, is combined with the base signal after an adaptive Kalman filter is applied according to the local standard deviation. We confirmed that the proposed method enhances the HDR images quality by checking the noise reduction in a dim surround region.","b353b8241b714b65a3af059d090352dc","","eng","naver"

Therefore, the audible frequency range is now produced by the loudspeaker system, which is consisted of more than two loudspeaker units. The multi-way loudspeaker system certainly requires a crossover filter, which is divided the audible frequency into low and high frequency ranges. The crossover frequency of filter usually is in the range of 1 ~ 4 kHz, the frequency range can largely affect to the sound articulation and quality. It is an example that the phase and amplitude at the crossover frequency can be different from each other, due to the variously reasons. Conversely, they can not produce the smooth frequency response due to the different distance between the two loudspeaker units and electrical properties. As a result, the sound articulation and quality can be degraded. Therefore, the phase and amplitude response at the crossover frequency has to be deeply considered, in order to exactly match the woofer and tweeter.

There are many disposal methods to remove odor, but there are many disadvantages and inadequate applications. The Purpose of this study was to develop a bag-filer system for odor removal using powder adsorbent. Methods: The bag-filter system is composed of a shear bag filter, an absorbent spraying system and an absorbent circulation system. The spraying absorbent system was connected with the inlet duct of the shear bag filter for inputting adsorbent. And the absorbent circulation system can transport the collecting adsorbent from hoper to the inlet duct of the system. As a result, the adsorbent can remove odor with recycling in the system. Also affective factors like the powdered absorbent combination and injection method was researched for maximization of system efficiency. The study was conducted in two stages. The first step was testing equipment made and the second is to evaluate the efficiency of the odor control by connecting to the actual odor generation process. Results: Both experiment stages showed efficient odor control ability. The adsorption efficiency of the system is demonstrated and the odor was adsorbed well by the powder adsorbent. It is essential to accurately understand the characteristics of the odorous and use the appropriate adsorbent. Although the powder adsorbent was used in the experiment, the problem of scattering did not occur due to the high degree of system sealing. Also the system manufactured in this study was designed to recycle the adsorbent, so adsorbent reuse or batch processing is convenient. Conclusions: The applicability of the system has been proven through this research.

Risk management is applicable to various fields, since it can manage the cost/schedule and effectively guides accomplishing the target performance by identifying and managing the risks in advance, which necessitates many concurrent studies. This paper proposes a procedure to estimate the severity value for a risk item using a Kalman filter. It is assumed that the severity can be expressed as an equation consisting of cost/schedule loss during the risk event. A linear Kalman filter is used to reduce the error between the true and estimated values, which can eventually save resources spent on the risk management procedure.

Wiener filter is used for noise cancellation and it clearly makes the shock pulse emerge from the time signal with the high level of noise.

If a base station has the injected false report, a false alarm also occurs and unnecessary energy of the node is used. In order to defend the attack, a statistical en-route filtering method is proposed to filter the false report that goes to the base station as soon as possible. A path renewal method, which improves the method, is proposed to maintain a detection ability of the statistical en-route filtering method and to consume balanced energy of the node.

Ores are mainly developed along the contact parts between quartz vein and arkosic sandstone beds(Fe-rich bed) in sedimentary rock. Electrum, silver sulfide and sulfate minerals are mainly in the ores. On the other hand, gold mineralization is less developed in cherty rock and andesitic rock than arkosic sandstone. The study highlights characteristics of gold precipitation in the deposit on the basis of numerical modelling of the reactions between the assumed hydrothermal ore fluids with multicomponent heterogeneous equilibrium calculations. Aqueous species, gases and minerals, containing electrum are included in the calculations. The reaction result between hydrothermal ore fluids and arkosic sandstone show that pH increasing in the ore-forming fluid would trigger precipitation of quartz, chlorite, sericite, chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, electrum, actinolite and feldspar. The numerical modelling also illustrates the drastic increase of pH and desulfidation lead to precipitation of electrum. Ag/Au ratios in the ore vary with pH conditions and subsequently precipitation of silver-bearing sulfides such as acanthite and polybasite. The modelling of the reaction between andesitic rock and ore-forming fluid shows that mineral assemblages of the case are analogous to ones of the reaction between arkosic sandstone and fluid except the latter has little portion of electrum. The abovementioned modelling results suggest that gold-silver mineralization is bounded by host rocks at the study area.","6497cbe5bc1f4f9f84602411a9f172fc","","eng","naver"

In this study several types of insulated meshes were prepared by coating #50 meshes with a dielectric material, Nylon 66, and the filtration property of air filter was evaluated at the presence of external electric field using those insulated meshes as electrodes and compared with that of filters using bared meshes. The collection efficiency of tested filter was increased from 78% to 95% for singly charged 100 nm particles by application of external electric field. As a result, there was no significant difference in collection efficiency between filters with insulated and bared electrodes.

In this study, we divide green-blue minerals into five groups (GJG) according to their external features and conducted XRD and SEM analyzes in order to identify mineral name and clarify the mineralogical characteristics. GJG-1, a bright bluish green group, consists of brochantite and quartz and GJG-2, a pale green colour with easily crumbly, of schulenbergite and a small amount of gypsum. Although pale blue GJG-3 and glassy lustrous bluish green GJG-4 have the same mineral assemblages with serpierite and gypsum in spite of different colour and luster, gypsum content may control the physical properties. GJG-5 with a gel phase mixture of pale blue and dark blue mineral is comprised of hydrowoodwardite, glaucocerinite, bechererite, serpierite and gypsum. The six green-blue minerals from the Gukjeon mine could be classified by Cu:Zn ratio, (Si + Al) content, Si:Al ratio, and Ca content. The physico-chemical environment of mineral formation is considered to be controlled by the geochemical factors in the surrounding fluid, and it looks forward that the accurate formation environment will be revealed through additional research. This paper gives greater mineralogical significance in the first report of several hydrated sulfate such as serpierite, glaucocerinite and bechererite in Korea.

Because the wheel speed is constantly changed during the operation of a reaction wheel, the vibration disturbance induced by the reaction wheels can magnify the satellite vibration when the rotating frequency of wheel meets the natural frequency of satellite structure. In order to provide an effective isolation of the reaction wheel disturbances, isolation performance of a hybrid vibration isolator is investigated.

Sandstorms originating from the deserts and dry areas in Northern China and Mongolia were transported on a massive scale during the springtime, thus contributing to the high AOD in East Asia. Although $PM_{10}$ with diameters ${\leq}10{\mu}m$ was the highest in February at Anmyon, Cheongwon and Ulleung, which is located leeward about half-way through the Korean Peninsula, AOD rose to a high in May. The growth of hygroscopic aerosols moving with increases in relative humidity prior to the Asian monsoon season contributed to a high AOD level in May. AE typically reaches its highest value ($1.30{\pm}0.37$) in August due to anthropogenic aerosols originating from industrial areas in Eastern China, while AOD stays low in summer due to the removal process caused by rainfall.

The multi-way loudspeaker system certainly requires a crossover filter, which is divided the audible frequency into low and high frequency ranges. The crossover frequency of filter usually is in the range of 1 ~ 4 kHz, the frequency range can largely affect to the sound articulation and quality. It is an example that the phase and amplitude at the crossover frequency can be different from each other, due to the variously reasons. Conversely, they can not produce the smooth frequency response due to the different distance between the two loudspeaker units and electrical properties.

One fuzzy output variable is the weighting factor to adjust for the Kalman gain. There is no need to decide the number and the membership function of input variables, because we employ the normalized monotone increasing/decreasing function. The single parameter to be determined is the magnitude of a universe of discourse in the output variable. The structure of the proposed FLS is simple and easy to apply to various nonlinear state estimation problems.

Ores are mainly developed along the contact parts between quartz vein and arkosic sandstone beds(Fe-rich bed) in sedimentary rock. Electrum, silver sulfide and sulfate minerals are mainly in the ores. On the other hand, gold mineralization is less developed in cherty rock and andesitic rock than arkosic sandstone. The study highlights characteristics of gold precipitation in the deposit on the basis of numerical modelling of the reactions between the assumed hydrothermal ore fluids with multicomponent heterogeneous equilibrium calculations. Aqueous species, gases and minerals, containing electrum are included in the calculations. The reaction result between hydrothermal ore fluids and arkosic sandstone show that pH increasing in the ore-forming fluid would trigger precipitation of quartz, chlorite, sericite, chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, electrum, actinolite and feldspar. The numerical modelling also illustrates the drastic increase of pH and desulfidation lead to precipitation of electrum. Ag/Au ratios in the ore vary with pH conditions and subsequently precipitation of silver-bearing sulfides such as acanthite and polybasite. The modelling of the reaction between andesitic rock and ore-forming fluid shows that mineral assemblages of the case are analogous to ones of the reaction between arkosic sandstone and fluid except the latter has little portion of electrum. The abovementioned modelling results suggest that gold-silver mineralization is bounded by host rocks at the study area.","429c72cfd05e489ca5c1e6022f7550cc","","eng","naver"

A linear Kalman filter is used to reduce the error between the true and estimated values, which can eventually save resources spent on the risk management procedure. A simulation test case was conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.","e3dba733b23a4ac9b8f495c0c4874aae","","eng","naver"

Among them, chlorotoluene and nitrotoluene are toxic to hydrobios and irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory organs of humans. We herein report the development of recombinant microbial biosensors for cheap and rapid monitoring of chlorotoluene and nitrotoluene compounds. Plasmids were constructed by inserting the xylR regulatory gene for BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) degradation into upstream of Po' (the DmpR activator promoter Po with the deletion of its own upstream activating sequences) or Pu (the cognate promoter of XylR)::lacZ (the ${\beta}$-galactosidase gene) and transformed into Escherichia coli $DH5{\alpha}$. In the presence of inducers, the biosensor cells immobilized in agarose developed a red color in 1-2 h due to the hydrolysis of chlorophenol red ${\beta}$-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG), a substrate of ${\beta}$-galactosidase that was expressed by the inducers. Among BTEX, high responses were specifically observed with o-, m-, p-chlorotoluene ($0.1{\mu}M-100 mM$) and o-, m-, p-nitrotoluene (0.1 mM-100 mM). Po' demonstrated higher responses than those with Pu. The biosensors immobilized in agarose showed good stability after 21 days' storage at $4^{\circ}C$, and responses in untreated wastewater spiked with chlorotoluene and nitrotoluene, suggesting they can be used to detect compounds in wastewater.","30a2eca54abd4bbe97ca2517946f6ab8","","eng","naver"

As the life time of the bearing is limited, the condition monitoring of bearing is very important to maintain the continuous operation without failures. A few monitoring techniques using time domain, frequency domain and fuzzy neural network vibration analysis are introduced to detect and diagnose the faults of the low speed machinery. This paper presents a method of fault detection for the rolling element bearing in the low speed machinery using the Wiener filtering and shock pulse counting techniques. Wiener filter is used for noise cancellation and it clearly makes the shock pulse emerge from the time signal with the high level of noise. The shock pulse counting is used to determine the various faults obviously from the shock signal with transient pulses not related with the bearing fault. Machine fault simulator is used for the experimental measurement in order to verify this technique is the powerful tool for the low speed machine compared with the frequency analysis. The test results show that the method proposed is very effective parameter even for the signal with high contaminated noise, speed variation and very low energy.

The porosity and pore size of the scaffolds were in the range of 66$\sim$72% and $300\sim400\;\mu$m, respectively. The sintering of the fabricated scaffolds under the vacuum caused the Ti particles to bond to each other. The strength of the scaffolds depended on the layering patterns. The compressive strength of the scaffolds ranged from 15 MPa to 52 MPa according to the scaffolds' architecture. The alkali treatment of the fabricated scaffolds in an aqueous NaOH solution was shown to be effective in improving the bioactivity. The surface of the alkali-treated Ti scaffolds had a nano-sized fibre-like structure. The modified surface showed a good apatite forming ability. The apatite was formed on the surface of the alkali treated Ti scaffolds within 1 day. The thickness of the apatite increased when the soaking time in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution increased.

Methods: Ten VOCs were measured by head-space gas chromatography in children's products, including toys, oil pastels, sign pens, furniture, ball pools, and playmats. We estimated the average daily dose (ADD) via inhalation during the use of these children's products and calculated hazard quotient (HQ) by dividing ADD by reference dose of VOCs. Results: Among the measured VOCs, five compounds were identified in children's products: benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, toluene, and xylene. The detection rates of VOCs in toys, ball pools, furniture, playmats, sign pens, and oil pastels were 85%, 100%, 100%, 30%, 100%, and 60%, respectively.

The aims of this study were to conduct exposure monitoring of toxic chemicals at fire scenes, to compare the concentrations of respective chemicals among firefighting tasks, and to assess the main factors influencing the concentrations of chemicals. Methods: Researchers performed sampling at firefighting scenes during four weeks in 2013. At the scene, we collected samples based on firefighters' own activities and examined the situation and scale of the accident. Collected samples were classified into three categories, including fire extinguishing and overhaul, and were analyzed in the laboratory according to respective analysis methods. Results: A total of fourteen fire activity events were surveyed: five fire extinguishing, six overhaul, and three fire investigations. Although no substance exceeded the ACGIH TLV, PAHs were detected in every sample. Naphthalene ranged from 0.24 to 279.13 mg/㎥ (median 49.6 mg/㎥) and benzo(a)pyrene was detected in one overhaul case at 10.85 ㎍/㎥. Benzene (0.01-12.2 ppm) was detected in every task and exceeded the ACGIH TLV. No significant difference in concentrations between tasks was shown.

For a better understanding of the metal removal mechanisms, batch experiments were performed using soil calcined at $850^{\circ}C$ under various pH conditions for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Cr. The results showed that the metal removal efficiency with the exception of Cr decreased abruptly, even within 5 min, showing more than 90% removal. The pH of each reactant increased gradually from around 7 to 9 with time. The increases in metal removal at higher pH appear to be associated with metal hydroxides precipitation. Comparative experiments, which were carried out changing the pH by reacting with commercial activated carbon (CAC), natural yellow soil (NYS), and calcined yellow soil (CYS), showed that the pH of the CYS only increased with time. Calcination processes might lead to a change in the physical properties of the soil matrix resulting in a high pH when reacted with water. Apart from adsorption onto the surface of the absorbents, these results show that the adsorption and/or precipitation of hydroxides onto the surface of adsorbents also play important roles in regulating the dissolved metals under alkaline conditions.","3efce94507c9454f8aeb25a97ce20e54","","eng","naver"

The silicate-coated rice seed (SCS) was prepared as follows. Naturally infested rice seeds not previously subjected to any fungicidal treatment were dressed with a mixture of 25% silicic acid at pH 11 and 300-mesh zeolite powder at a ratio of 50 g dry seed - 9 mL silicic acid - 25 g zeolite powder. The following nursery conditions were provided : Early sowing, dense seeding in a glass house with mulching overnight and no artificial heating, which were the ideal conditions for determining the effect on the seed. The nursery plants were evaluated for Gibberella. fujikuroi infection or to determine the recovery to normal growth of infected nursery plants in the Wagner pot. Seedlings emerged 2-3 days earlier for the SCS than they did for the non-SCS control, while damping-off and bakanae disease incidence were remarkably reduced. Specifically, bakanae disease incidence in the SCS was limited to only 7.8% for 80 days after sowing, as compared to 91.6% of the non-SCS control. For the 45-days-old SCS nursery seedlings, the fresh weight was increased by 11% and was two times heavier, with only mild damage compared to that observed for non-SCS. Even after transplanting, SCS treatment contributed to a lower incidence of further infections and possibly to recovery of the seedlings to normal growth as compared to that observed in symptomatic plants in the pot. The active pathogenic macro-conidia and micro-conidia were considerably lower in the soil, root, and seedling sheath base of the SCS. In particular, the underdeveloped macro-conidia with straight oblong shape without intact septum were isolated in the SCS ; this phenotype is likely to be at a comparative etiological disadvantage when compared to that of typical active macro-conidia, which are slightly sickle-shaped with 3-7 intact septa. A active intact conidia with high inoculum potential were rarely observed in the tissue of the seedlings treated only in the SCS. We propose that promising result was likely achieved via inhibition of the development of intact pathogenic conidia, in concert with the aerobic, acidic conditions induced by the physiochemical characteristics associated with the air porosity of zeolite, alkalinity of silicate and the seed husk as a carbon source. In addition, the resistance of the healthy plants to pathogenic conidia was also important factor.","ed4d8a130e22416d88130d4db8ee5921","","eng","naver"

The initial discharge capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the hierarchically porous $Fe_2O_3$ nanofibers at a current density of $1.0A\;g^{-1}$ are $1190mA\;h\;g^{-1}$ and 79.2%. Additionally, the discharge capacity of the nanofibers is $792mA\;h\;g^{-1}$ after 1,000 cycles. The high structural stability and morphological benefits of the hierarchically porous $Fe_2O_3$ nanofibers resulted in superior lithium ion storage performance.","dba5461962b34dd8a4135c8f8313051f","","eng","naver"

The results showed that the metal removal efficiency with the exception of Cr decreased abruptly, even within 5 min, showing more than 90% removal.

This study investigated the effects of stocking density and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the growth and hematology of the parrotfish in the RAS. The experimental stocking densities were 5 (SD05), 10 (SD10), 15 (SD15), and 20 kg/m3 (SD20) total body weight to tank water volume. As the stocking density increased, the mean weight gain, feed efficiency, and specific growth rate tended to decrease. However, SD10 and SD15 did not differ statistically from SD05 in feed efficiency (P>0.05). Although better growth was achieved in SD05, SD10 and SD15 appeared to be acceptable, practically and economically, in terms of feed efficiency. The experimental DO concentration ranges were 3-4 (DO3), 5-6 (DO5), and 7-8 mg/L (DO7). The mean weight gain and survival tended to increase with the DO concentration, but there were no differences among treatments (P>0.05). Although the feed efficiency did not differ among the treatments, the specific growth rates and daily feed intake increased with the DO concentration and were the highest in DO7 (P<0.05). The cortisol concentration was the highest in DO3 (P<0.05), while there was no difference between DO5 and DO7 (P>0.05).","cc17bb6f86044faea97451e5e2b8e5ca","","eng","naver"

Protein content increased with an increase in the amount of N and timing of application. The SDS segmentation volume (SDSS) increased with an increase in N, but there was no effect of the timing of N application on SDSS. An increase in N amount and timing of application caused a difference in dough properties, such as water absorption, mixing time, and tolerance, among the cultivars. Soluble and insoluble polymeric and monomeric protein contents increased with an increase in N amount and timing of application the three Korean wheat cultivars. The effects of N amount and application timing on bread loaf volume (BLV) varied among the cultivars. The BLV of Saekeumkang increased regardless of the N amount and timing of application, but that of Baekkang and Joongmo2008 cultivars was reduced. However, there was a positive correlation between protein content with the addition of N fertilization and BLV. In addition, SDSS, mixing time, and protein fractions were positively correlated with BLV. Since the response of fertilizer conditions was different for each wheat cultivar, it is necessary to build a suitable fertilizing system for each of them.

The absorption performance of the perforated panel type of resonator is obtained by acoustic analysis and experiment. The analytical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. In the case of multiple perforated panel type resonators, as the number of perforated panels increase, the 1st resonance frequency is moved to a low frequency band and sound absorption bandwidth is extended on the whole.

To overcome this a Fresnelet transform for a digital hologram has been proposed. We derive a Fresnelet transform by using the Daubechie's filter after applying an unitary Fresnel transform to a wavelet basis function.

The silicate-coated rice seed (SCS) was prepared as follows. Naturally infested rice seeds not previously subjected to any fungicidal treatment were dressed with a mixture of 25% silicic acid at pH 11 and 300-mesh zeolite powder at a ratio of 50 g dry seed - 9 mL silicic acid - 25 g zeolite powder. The following nursery conditions were provided : Early sowing, dense seeding in a glass house with mulching overnight and no artificial heating, which were the ideal conditions for determining the effect on the seed. The nursery plants were evaluated for Gibberella. fujikuroi infection or to determine the recovery to normal growth of infected nursery plants in the Wagner pot. Seedlings emerged 2-3 days earlier for the SCS than they did for the non-SCS control, while damping-off and bakanae disease incidence were remarkably reduced. Specifically, bakanae disease incidence in the SCS was limited to only 7.8% for 80 days after sowing, as compared to 91.6% of the non-SCS control. For the 45-days-old SCS nursery seedlings, the fresh weight was increased by 11% and was two times heavier, with only mild damage compared to that observed for non-SCS. Even after transplanting, SCS treatment contributed to a lower incidence of further infections and possibly to recovery of the seedlings to normal growth as compared to that observed in symptomatic plants in the pot. The active pathogenic macro-conidia and micro-conidia were considerably lower in the soil, root, and seedling sheath base of the SCS. In particular, the underdeveloped macro-conidia with straight oblong shape without intact septum were isolated in the SCS ; this phenotype is likely to be at a comparative etiological disadvantage when compared to that of typical active macro-conidia, which are slightly sickle-shaped with 3-7 intact septa. A active intact conidia with high inoculum potential were rarely observed in the tissue of the seedlings treated only in the SCS. We propose that promising result was likely achieved via inhibition of the development of intact pathogenic conidia, in concert with the aerobic, acidic conditions induced by the physiochemical characteristics associated with the air porosity of zeolite, alkalinity of silicate and the seed husk as a carbon source. In addition, the resistance of the healthy plants to pathogenic conidia was also important factor.","4f8378e1f6a749878b6ca3232e4ebff6","","eng","naver"

Accordingly, leaching and solvent extraction methods for the extraction of copper from copper ore were studied with a particular emphasis on developing a simple processing method for small-scale copper mining. Chrysocolla ore was used as the copper-bearing mineral and sulfuric acid was used as the leaching reagent. A maximum copper recovery of 95.1% was obtained when the particles in the sample were smaller than $53{\mu}m$, the concentration of 98%(w/w) sulfuric acid in the leaching solution was 5.0 g/L and the stirring rate was between 60 and 80 rpm. The highest selectivity of $Cu^2+$ in the solvent extraction was obtained using 15% LIX-70 in kerosene. In the pH range from 0.5 to 3.0, the efficiency of $Cu^2+$ extraction increased with increasing pH. However, at pH values higher than 3.0, other metal ions were extracted into the organic phase more readily than $Cu^2+$. The highest solvent extraction rate obtained was 96.5% at pH values of 2.0 and 3.0 using 15% LIX-70.","bd3cf2f11d64463f82c3e1d26291a82d","","eng","naver"

At $30 -60^{\circ}C$, the leaching efficiency of Cu was increased but it was decreased at $70 - 80^{\circ}C$. The results were due to the increasing of hydrogen peroxide decomposition in the solution above $70^{\circ}C$. In the case of ethylene glycol added at $80^{\circ}C$, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was decreased and the leaching efficiency was increased. As a result of SEM analysis of leaching residue after leaching, the residue was found to porous form in the case of the ethylene glycol added and then the leaching efficiency of Cu was increased by the increase of surface area under $60^{\circ}C$ with ethylene glycol.","ab8f559115a043f4adf938a076804f5e","","eng","naver"

The objective of the present study was to investigate improvement in immediate speech intelligibility in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (age range: 46 to 75 years) using Clear Speech. This experiment has been performed using the Phonatory Aerodynamic System 6600 after the participants read the first sentence of a Sanchaek passage and the ""List for Adults 1"" in the Sentence Recognition Test (SRT) using casual speech and Clear Speech. Acoustic and aerodynamic parameters that affect speech intelligibility were measured, including mean F0, F0 range, intensity, speaking rate, mean airflow rate, and respiratory rate. In the Sanchaek passage, use of Clear Speech resulted in significant differences in mean F0, F0 range, speaking rate, and respiratory rate, compared with the use of casual speech. In the SRT list, significant differences were seen in mean F0, F0 range, and speaking rate. Based on these findings, it is claimed that speech intelligibility can be affected by adjusting breathing and tone in Clear Speech.

In addition, using data obtained during the hydraulic experiments, experimental equations are developed to estimate the amount of air drawn in through the air vent. In case of pressurized flow conditions downstream of hydraulic jumps, the relationships between $\frac{Q_a}{Q_w}$ and $Fr_g-1$ of the data form a experimental equation, $\frac{Q_a}{Q_w}=0.0304(Fr_g-1)^{1.0622}$; in case of free surface flow conditions, $\frac{Q_a}{Q_w}=0.0271(Fr_g-1)^{1.8205}$. Comparing two data sets observed under the two flow regimes with the results of previous researchers, patterns of the data sets are similar to the results estimated using the equations presented previously, and this indicates that the quality of the data obtained during the hydraulic experiments is ensured. In addition, it is revealed that air entrainment phenomena in the regions close to air vents are affected by the characteristics of supercritical flows downstream of gates. Finally, it is concluded that the equation developed for pressurized flow conditions can be applied to design of air vents.","bfa3b646967d4d98b8d3bb8ccd9bc52f","","eng","naver"

However, due to the nature of the air compressor, it is difficult to install a position sensor. In order to control the permanent magnet type synchronous motor at variable speed, the inclusion of a position sensor to grasp the position of the rotor is essential. Therefore, in order to achieve sensorless control, it is essential to use a permanent magnet type synchronous motor in the compressor. The position estimation method based on the back electromotive force, which is widely used as the sensorless control method, has a limitation in that position errors occur due either to the phase delay caused by the use of a stationary coordinate system or to the estimated back electromotive force in the transient state caused by the use of a synchronous coordinate system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of estimating the position and velocity using a rotation angle tracking observer and reducing the speed ripple through a disturbance observer. An experimental apparatus was constructed using Freescale's MPU and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm was examined. It was confirmed that even if a position error occurs at a certain point in time, the position correction value converges to the actual vector position when the position error value is found.","2cbb18bec33d404d892b62fce377ae9d","","eng","naver"

Finally, the thermal conductivity of the composites is predicted using the modified Eshelby model. The predicted results by the representative models and hybrid model are compared for the composite with aligned- and coated-short fibers of single aspect ratio.

The output signal of the comparator controls the sub charge pump and reduces the input voltage variation of voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).

In this study several types of insulated meshes were prepared by coating #50 meshes with a dielectric material, Nylon 66, and the filtration property of air filter was evaluated at the presence of external electric field using those insulated meshes as electrodes and compared with that of filters using bared meshes. The collection efficiency of tested filter was increased from 78% to 95% for singly charged 100 nm particles by application of external electric field. As a result, there was no significant difference in collection efficiency between filters with insulated and bared electrodes.

However, due to the nature of the air compressor, it is difficult to install a position sensor. In order to control the permanent magnet type synchronous motor at variable speed, the inclusion of a position sensor to grasp the position of the rotor is essential. Therefore, in order to achieve sensorless control, it is essential to use a permanent magnet type synchronous motor in the compressor. The position estimation method based on the back electromotive force, which is widely used as the sensorless control method, has a limitation in that position errors occur due either to the phase delay caused by the use of a stationary coordinate system or to the estimated back electromotive force in the transient state caused by the use of a synchronous coordinate system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of estimating the position and velocity using a rotation angle tracking observer and reducing the speed ripple through a disturbance observer. An experimental apparatus was constructed using Freescale's MPU and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm was examined. It was confirmed that even if a position error occurs at a certain point in time, the position correction value converges to the actual vector position when the position error value is found.","225934555ba6455ba9185da18cd3fd3f","","eng","naver"

The extent of $CO_2$ adsorption on the microporous materials depends on the metal species and organic linkers existing in the frameworks. The pore size and the surface area, and the process variables are the key parameters to be associated with the efficiency of the adsorbents, particularly adsorption pressures if other variables are comparable each other.

To better resolve the geometrically complex upper core structure of the MONJU reactor, the porous media approach was adopted for the simulation. First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the turbine trip test conducted in December 1995. The time dependent inlet conditions for the mass flow rate and temperature were provided by JAEA. Good agreement with the experimental data was observed for steady state solution. The numerical solution of the transient analysis shows the formation of thermal stratification within the upper plenum of the reactor vessel during the turbine trip test. The temporal variations of temperature were predicted accurately by the present method in the initial rapid coastdown period (~300 seconds). However, transient numerical solutions show a faster thermal mixing than that observed in the experiment after the initial coastdown period. A nearly homogenization of the temperature field in the upper plenum is predicted after about 900 seconds, which is a much shorter-term thermal stratification than the experimental data indicates.

Calculations were performed for a 1/6 simplified model of the MONJU reactor using the commercial code, CFX-13. To better resolve the geometrically complex upper core structure of the MONJU reactor, the porous media approach was adopted for the simulation. First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the turbine trip test conducted in December 1995. The time dependent inlet conditions for the mass flow rate and temperature were provided by JAEA. Good agreement with the experimental data was observed for steady state solution. The numerical solution of the transient analysis shows the formation of thermal stratification within the upper plenum of the reactor vessel during the turbine trip test. The temporal variations of temperature were predicted accurately by the present method in the initial rapid coastdown period (~300 seconds). However, transient numerical solutions show a faster thermal mixing than that observed in the experiment after the initial coastdown period. A nearly homogenization of the temperature field in the upper plenum is predicted after about 900 seconds, which is a much shorter-term thermal stratification than the experimental data indicates. This discrepancy is due to the shortcoming of the turbulence models available in the CFX-13 code for a natural convection flow with thermal stratification.","4670e11dd80146e3a408f01d05675ee9","","eng","naver"

The cement mortars are fabricated with 1:1(binder to fine aggregate), 1 : 3 and 1 : 5 respectively, which are replaced 30% of FA by cement. Test results, indicated that, the flow of Ra showed lower flowability than Rf at all mixing ratios. Also in the case of Rj, it was expected to show low fluidity, but it showed flowability equal to or higher than Rf. Air contents are all formulations except Rf and Rj did not satisfy the target range. Using Ra, the refining process shows an air amount about 41% lower than Rf, in the case of Rj, it showed about 19% higher air content than Rf due to porous foreign matters inside the mortar. Compressive strength was in the early days 3 and 7, the strength was lower than that of Plain's OPC, after 28 days Rf exerts higher strength than other FAs, it was confirmed that higher strength than OPC can be secured at a mixing ratio of 1: 1 and 1: 3. For frost resistance, the use of unrefined FA resulted in decrease of frost resistance sharply due to loss of air content by the use of unrefined FA. Therefore, it is considered that the use of high quality FA through refining process will contribute positively to the economical formulation of concrete and the stability of the structure.","5838c76144f447d8b11770ac06b9c20e","","eng","naver"

Scanning electron microscopy revealed that ultrasound sonication did not form pores on the surfaces, but caused damages such as depression and erosion. Pasting viscosity of starch decreased with an increase in the severity of sonication conditions because of the weakened polymer network.

This study assessed the growth inhibition effect of HCC against Microcystis aeruginosa which is one of the most common toxic cyanobacterium in eutrophic freshwater environment. Various HCC doses, ranging from 5.5 to $550{\mu}g/L$ as $Cu^{2+}$, were applied to either BG-11 or 1/4 diluted medium with low- or high-inoculum density of M. aeruginosa. Growth inhibition was monitored based on a decrease in chlorophyll-a content in culture medium during the incubation. Results showed that HCC significantly inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent manner. In case of 1/4 diluted BG-11 medium, HCC dose as low as $5.5{\mu}g$ $Cu^{2+}/L$ completely inhibited the production of chlorophyll-a by M. aeruginosa. It was found that HCC did not induce any significant release of microcystin-LR from M. aeruginosa. Acute toxicity of HCC was tested using Daphnia magna, and the 24-h $EC_{50}$ value was 0.30 mg/L as $Cu^{2+}$ which was much higher than the actual inhibition dose. Ames test was performed using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TA100, and HCC showed no increase in the number of revertant colonies. The result suggested that HCC does not have any mutagenic potential in the aquatic environment. In addition, no genotoxic effect of HCC was also confirmed based on the SOS ChromoTest using Escherichia coli PQ37. Therefore, HCC could be used as a relatively safe and effective pre- and post-treatment agent to control hazardous algal blooming in aquatic environments.","684a4e04c0ab467887611fb7cd537db7","","eng","naver"

Scanning electron microscopy revealed that ultrasound sonication did not form pores on the surfaces, but caused damages such as depression and erosion. Pasting viscosity of starch decreased with an increase in the severity of sonication conditions because of the weakened polymer network. X-ray diffraction suggested that the crystalline domains in starch were not susceptible to sonication and were more resistance to degradation.

The investigated process parameters were separation coefficient, rate constant, rate controlling step, activation energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy. The adsorption of RO 16 was the highest at pH 3 due to the electrostatic attraction between the cations (H+) on the surface of the activated carbon and the sulfonate ions and hydroxy ions possessed by RO 16. Isotherm data were fitted into Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models by applying the evaluated separation factor of Langmuir (RL=0.459~0.491) and Freundlich (1/n=0.398~0.441). Therefore, the adsorption operation of RO 16 by activated carbon was confirmed as an appropriate removal method. Temkin's adsorption energy indicated that this adsorption process was physical adsorption. The adsorption kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of RO 16 follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and that the rate controlling step in the adsorption process was the intraparticle diffusion step. The positive enthalpy change indicated an endothermic process. The negative Gibbs free energy change decreased in the order of -3.16 <-11.60 <-14.01 kJ/mol as the temperature increased.

Pseudo second order equation and Langmuir-3 isotherm are more applicable in the adsorption kinetic model and adsorption isotherm model, respectively. As a result of the desorption experiment, the filter media does not exceed KSLT which is the hazardous substance leaching limit, showing the capability of the filter media in LID. The bioceramic and woodchip as filter medias were evaluated and exhibited excellent adsorption capacity for Pb.","66e899e992414c00b927a452923c4949","","eng","naver"

Using a area-contact scratch tip which can apply a relatively low stress level to the coated surfaces, the mar damages were generated on the surfaces. When evaluating the mar-induced damage by means of delta-gloss (${\Delta}G$) and delta-luminance (${\Delta}L$) with existing test methodologies, an increase in constant load on the same gloss-coated surface leads to an increase in ${\Delta}G$ and ${\Delta}L$. However, these are not suitable for evaluating and comparing the surface damages of different gloss-coated samples because of a disagreement between the measured values and the mar visibility. It is shown that new mar test assessment proposed in this work not only can be used to quantitatively evaluate the mar damage, but also accounts for the correlation that the increases of the normalized gloss and luminance on coated surfaces correspond with an increase in the mar visibility.","23c0c3a1099849a2bba0ec3d40674a8e","","eng","naver"

When TBD was 6 mmol/g, the $CO_2$ adsorption capacity was the highest at 7.3 wt%, and the adsorption capacity decreased due to the blocking phenomenon when the TBD amount increased.","8b36cc8ad14d4abb8775a09595887064","","eng","naver"

The usual operating conditions are adsorption temperatures of $15{\sim}40^{\circ}C$ and adsorption pressures of 4~6 bar based on numerous PSA processes which are widely employed in gases industry for adsorptive separation of $CO_2$. The extent of $CO_2$ adsorption on the microporous materials depends on the metal species and organic linkers existing in the frameworks. The pore size and the surface area, and the process variables are the key parameters to be associated with the efficiency of the adsorbents, particularly adsorption pressures if other variables are comparable each other. The MOFs and ZIFs materials require high pressures greater than 15 bar to yield significant $CO_2$ uptakes. They possess a $CO_2$ adsorption capacity which is very similar to or less than that of conventional benchmark adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons. Consequently, those materials have been much less cost-effective for adsorptive $CO_2$ separation to date because of very high production price and the absence of commercially-proven PSA processes using such new adsorbents.","05a895cff6a64b709f48a11c218bd0c0","","eng","naver"

Due to the increase in impervious surface by urbanization, developed countries apply low impact development (LID) techniques as important alternatives to reduce the impacts of urbanization. In Korea, LID techniques were employed since 2012 in order to manage nonpoint source pollutants. LID technology is a technique for removing pollutants using a variety of physical, chemical and biological mechanisms in plants, microorganisms and filter media with the reduced effluence of stormwater runoff by mimicking natural water circulation system. These LID facilities are used in a variety of filter media, but an assessment has not been carried out for the comprehensive comparison evaluation of adsorption and desorption characteristics for the pollutant removal capacity. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the adsorption and desorption characteristics of various filter media used in the LID facilities such as sand, gravel, bioceramic, wood chips and bottom ash etc. in reducing heavy metals(Pb, Cu). In this study, the adsorption affinity for Pb in all filter media was higher than Cu. Pseudo second order equation and Langmuir-3 isotherm are more applicable in the adsorption kinetic model and adsorption isotherm model, respectively. As a result of the desorption experiment, the filter media does not exceed KSLT which is the hazardous substance leaching limit, showing the capability of the filter media in LID. The bioceramic and woodchip as filter medias were evaluated and exhibited excellent adsorption capacity for Pb.","9b43dacacaff4c81b9ddfbac7067c59b","","eng","naver"

Recently, many studies have examined the optical properties, such as light scattering, refraction, transmission characteristics, by coating organic-inorganic materials on a substrate, such as mica. Mica is widely applied as a pigment, plastics, painted products, and ceramics because of its high chemical stability, durability and non-toxicity. Magnesium oxide has a range of properties, such as high light transmittance, corrosion resistance and non-toxicity, and it is used as an optical material and polymer additives. To use the optical properties of mica and magnesium oxide, mica was coated with magnesium hydroxide by a dissolution and recrystallization process. In this study, the optimal conditions for the haze value of the particles were found by adjusting the amount of precursors and pH. Magnesium hydroxide layers were formed on the surfaces of mica and converted to MgO after calcination at $400^{\circ}C$ for 4 h. The results showed that the value of MgO-coated mica haze can be controlled easily by the amount of the magnesium hydroxide and pH. The optical properties of the inorganic composite powder were analyzed using a hazemeter and the highest haze value was 85.92 % at pH 9.

To reduce such noises, multi-chamber perforated muffler has been designed. In this paper, in order to improve the transmission loss of a perforated muffler, the relationship between the impedance model of a perforated hole and its noise reduction performance is studied, and the applicability of a short-length perforated muffler to air processing unit of fuel cell system is described using acoustic simulation results and experimental data.

Clogging reduces infiltration rate and lifespan of the facility. Clogging, thus, needs to be considered as one of the important design factors in constructing infiltration facilities.

The coated rice seeds (SCS) which were dressed with the mixture of 25% silicic acids (binder), and the zeolite (coating powder). In wet direct seeding, uniform scattering of rice seeds on the soil surface and the better seedling establishment were shown in SCS treatment plots. The incidence of bakanae disease began from the mid tillering stage toward the heading stage. Around heading stage, the ratio of infected tillers reached its highest point by 9.9% in non-SCS treatment plots. While, in SCS treatment plots, the ratio of infected tillers was no more than 0.01%. The vitality of the pathogenic fungi of bakanae disease in the SCS and non-SCS samples were assessed. Samples were incubated for one week keeping proper humidity at $30^{\circ}C$ after inoculated with panicles of infected rice plants from experimental field plots. In non-SCS treatment, pinkish colonies were formed on the grain surface of panicle of infected plants, and mycelium, macro-conidia and micro-conidia were developed actively inside part of infected grain inoculated. While in SCS treatment, micro-conidia and mycelium were not survived and the growth of macro-conidia, mycelia were greatly inhibited and withered. Based on the results, it is concluded that the environmental friendly control of bakanae disease by use of SCS is possible and soluble silicate can be applied as agents for replacement of seed disinfection.","f288c51e441b4be6b02023646ed566c0","","eng","naver"

For 2 kinds of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea, the U removal efficiency at various initial U concentrations in water were investigated and the optimal sorption conditions to apply the bamboo charcoal were determined by the batch experiments with replicate at different pH, temperature, and reaction time conditions. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the U removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal ranged from 70 % to 97 % and the U removal efficiency for the genuine groundwater of which U concentration was 0.14 mg/L was 84 %. The high U removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures ($10{\sim}20^{\circ}C$) and pHs (5 ~ 9), supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is available for U contaminated groundwater without additional treatment process in field. Two typical sorption isotherms were plotted by using the experimental results and the bamboo charcoal for U complied with the Langmuir adsorption property. The maximum adsorption concentration ($q_m:mg/g$) of A type and C type bamboo charcoal in the Langmuir isotherm model were 200.0 mg/g and 16.9 mg/g, respectively. When 2 g of bamboo charcoal was added into 100 mL of U contaminated groundwater (0.04 ~ 10.8 mg/L of initial U concentration), the separation factor ($R_L$) and the surface coverage (${\theta}$) maintained lower than 1, suggesting that the U contaminated groundwater can be cleaned up with a small amount of the bamboo charcoal.","664923034f3f45f6ac30adb5379a6740","","eng","naver"

The extent of $CO_2$ adsorption on the microporous materials depends on the metal species and organic linkers existing in the frameworks.

The small particle separation from the soil was conducted to decrease the initial concentration of heavy metals and to increase the washing effectiveness before the soil washing and 4.1 % of the soil were separated as small particles (< 0.075 mm in diameter). The small particle separation lowered down Zn and Pb concentrations of soil to 1256.3 mg/kg (27.9 % decrease) and 325.8 mg/kg (56.3 % decrease). However, the Zn concentration of soil without small particles still was higher than the 2nd SPWL even after the soil washing, suggesting that the additional process is necessary to lower Zn concentration to below the 2nd SPWL after the treatment process.

There are many disposal methods to remove odor, but there are many disadvantages and inadequate applications. The Purpose of this study was to develop a bag-filer system for odor removal using powder adsorbent. Methods: The bag-filter system is composed of a shear bag filter, an absorbent spraying system and an absorbent circulation system. The spraying absorbent system was connected with the inlet duct of the shear bag filter for inputting adsorbent. And the absorbent circulation system can transport the collecting adsorbent from hoper to the inlet duct of the system. As a result, the adsorbent can remove odor with recycling in the system. Also affective factors like the powdered absorbent combination and injection method was researched for maximization of system efficiency. The study was conducted in two stages. The first step was testing equipment made and the second is to evaluate the efficiency of the odor control by connecting to the actual odor generation process. Results: Both experiment stages showed efficient odor control ability. The adsorption efficiency of the system is demonstrated and the odor was adsorbed well by the powder adsorbent. It is essential to accurately understand the characteristics of the odorous and use the appropriate adsorbent. Although the powder adsorbent was used in the experiment, the problem of scattering did not occur due to the high degree of system sealing. Also the system manufactured in this study was designed to recycle the adsorbent, so adsorbent reuse or batch processing is convenient. Conclusions: The applicability of the system has been proven through this research. Customized systems for industrial process and the appropriate adsorbent base on the characteristics of pollutant generation will show efficient odor collection ability.","c8b58946493f4221a01c377817c4f446","","eng","naver"

Test results, indicated that, the flow of Ra showed lower flowability than Rf at all mixing ratios. Also in the case of Rj, it was expected to show low fluidity, but it showed flowability equal to or higher than Rf. Air contents are all formulations except Rf and Rj did not satisfy the target range.

Through the evaluation of adsorptive separation performances in terms of working capacity, selectivity, and Adsorption Figure of Merit (AFM), we have suggested proper density and strength of adsorption sites as well as appropriate temperature condition to obtain optimal propylene/propane adsorptive separation performances.","8fab027123ef48ac9f2200a96692bb79","","eng","naver"

The results showed that runoff from the pavement road contains 5.6 and 20 times higher SS and Pb concentrations, respectively, than that from the parking lot. The particles smaller than $100{\mu}m$ occupied 89.8 % of runoff from the pavement road and 81.4 % of that from the parking lot by volume. The effect of the hydraulic loading, at 950 m/day filtering linar velocity and 40 cm head loss, was largest for Zeolite, followed by Perlite, EPS, and EPP. The return period of tested media calculated by the regression equation for head loss indicated that EPP has the longest life time. The average SS removal rate was similar for all media at between 84.9 % and 89 %, while the effect of various filter column heights was different, showing minimal for EPP and maximum for EPS.

A key component of PSA systems is adsorbents that should be highly selective to a gas being separated from its mixture streams and have isotherms suitable for the operation principle. The six standard types of isotherms have been examined in this review, and among them the best behavior in the adsorption of $CO_2$ as a function of pressure was proposed in aspects of maximizing a working capacity upon excursion between adsorption and desorption cycles. Zeolites and molecular sieves are historically typical adsorbents for such PSA applications in gas and related industries, and their physicochemical features, e.g., framework, channel structure, pore size, Si-to-Al ratio (SAR), and specific surface area, are strongly associated with the extent of $CO_2$ adsorption at given conditions and those points have been extensively described with literature data.

The calorimetric value and combustion temperature of heat papers were reduced with an increase in the molten salt coating. As a result, the molten salt coating on heat papers greatly reduced risk of a thermal runaway and improved the stability of thermal batteries.","80ff161f9d9f4b5e97d2e9b5cd967089","","eng","naver"

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","4c984baaf4a24dfe9b9038e138a8d46f","","eng","naver"

The maximum weight loss of food waste was obtained at the fermentation-extinction experiments by using C bio wood chip. On the other hands, the maximum ratio of ATP to COD and TN was obtained from $3.00{\times}10^{-10}$ and $2.31{\times}10^{-11}$ in the case of C bio wood chip, comparing with other types of bio wood chip. Consequently, the performance of weight loss rate was affected with the micro pore structure of bio wood chip which have an advantage of extensive microbial activity space in the fermentation-extinction of food waste.","12a7e4c3b3a24412ba2272bfdece0b0d","","eng","naver"

In this study, the chloride adsorption ability of the AER powder was investigated under the conditions of distilled water and calcium hydroxide saturated solution to determine if the AER powder is less effective to increase the chloride adsorption ability after grinding process. The chloride adsorption ability of AER powder was compared with the previous research about the chloride adsorption of AER bead. In addition, the compressive strength, chloride diffusion coefficient (using NT Build 492 method), and the chloride profile of cement mortar substituted with AER powder were investigated. There was no decrease in the chloride adsorption capacity of AER powder but increase in the kinetic property for chloride adsorption after the grinding process. The AER powder could absorb the chloride ion in the mortar quickly, and showed better chloride ion adsorption ability than the cement hydrates.","f50bf3d7aedf496ca7d4bb242dc709ed","","eng","naver"

The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. The results indicated that the Langmuir model provides the best correlation of the experimental data. The separation factor of the Langmuir and Freundlich model showed that the adsorption treatment of acid blue 40 by activated carbon could be an effective adsorption process. The adsorption energy determined by the Temkin equation showed that the adsorption step is a physical adsorption process. Kinetics analysis of the adsorption process of acid blue 40 on activated carbon showed that a pseudo second order kinetic model is more consistent than a pseudo second order kinetic model.

For 2 kinds of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea, the U removal efficiency at various initial U concentrations in water were investigated and the optimal sorption conditions to apply the bamboo charcoal were determined by the batch experiments with replicate at different pH, temperature, and reaction time conditions. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the U removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal ranged from 70 % to 97 % and the U removal efficiency for the genuine groundwater of which U concentration was 0.14 mg/L was 84 %. The high U removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures ($10{\sim}20^{\circ}C$) and pHs (5 ~ 9), supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is available for U contaminated groundwater without additional treatment process in field. Two typical sorption isotherms were plotted by using the experimental results and the bamboo charcoal for U complied with the Langmuir adsorption property. The maximum adsorption concentration ($q_m:mg/g$) of A type and C type bamboo charcoal in the Langmuir isotherm model were 200.0 mg/g and 16.9 mg/g, respectively.

Increase in the amount of grafted 2NS should caused decrease in pore volume and diameter. Consequently, it decreased the amount of supported metallocene and MAO in general. However, the smaller pore-sized MCM-41 could have lower supported MAO content due to its large molecular size in case that MCM-41 was surface-functionalized with 2NS. Therefore, the supported metallocene content could increase and its polymerization activity was higher than that of SBA-15.","16e5ed26ed534c7699ecaa15c70593df","","eng","naver"

For the phosphorus, in case assuming a power relationship between rate constant and temperature, the best prediction result were obtained, but temperature was most sensitive parameter affecting phosphorus removal. In addition, denitrification was always a limiting step for the nitrogen removal in this particular wetland mostly due to the lack of carbon source and high dissolved oxygen concentration.

Methods: In this study, zirconia block was dipped into $Fe(NO_3)_3$solution, which showed a color and then concentration of $Fe(NO_3)_3$and zirconia's color and physical properties depending on the dipping time were observed and compared with exclusive coloring solutions. As the result, the following conclusions were obtained. Results: When compared with the specimens that were colored using exclusive solutions, $L^*$ value rose overall depending on the concentration of $Fe(NO_3)_3$and $a^*$ value was red in the form of (+) in all the specimens. Also, $b^*$ value was in the form of (+) at 0.5 to $1{\ss}fl$, but was in the form of (-) at 1.5 to $2{\ss}fl$. The dipping time did not highly influence $L^*$ value, but $a^*$ value and $b^*$ value were directly opposite to the specimens, which were not colored, except the sample that was dipped for only 2 seconds. When compared with exclusive coloring solutions, $Fe(NO_3)_3$had the most similar color at 0.5 to $1{\ss}fl$ and the longer the coloring time, the higher the rate of color change became. In relation to the density change depending on the addition of $Fe(NO_3)_3$, there was the lowest density at $2{\ss}fl$ and the density was increased in the specimens that were not colored. Conclusion: These results show that $Fe(NO_3)_3$solution can be used to make colored zirconia. It is expected that newly made colored zirconia can be used in clinical practice because the colored zirconia not only possesses the mechanical properties that all ceramic core material should have but also was biocompatible to a living cells.","8a0d1650f2b440a4b0ad88000f7f3598","","eng","naver"

However, carbon and nutrient source is often a limiting factor for microalgal growth leading to higher input costs for sufficient biomass production. Use of municipal wastewater as a low cost alternative to grow microalgae as well as to treat the same has been demonstrated in this study using mini raceway open ponds. Municipal wastewater was collected after primary treatment and microalgae indigenous in the wastewater were encouraged to grow in open raceways under optimum conditions. The mean removal efficiencies of TN, TP, COD-$_{Mn}$, $NH_3$-N after 6 days of retention time was 80.18%, 63.56%, 76.34%, and 96.74% respectively. The 18S rRNA gene analysis of the community revealed the presence of Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus as the dominant microalgae. In addition, 16S rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that Rhodobacter, Luteimonas, Porphyrobacter, Agrobacterium, and Thauera were present along with the microalgae. From these results, it is concluded that microalgae could be used to effectively treat municipal wastewater without aerobic treatment, which incurs additional energy costs. In addition, municipal wastewater shall also serve as an excellent carbon and nitrogen source for microalgal growth. Moreover, the microalgal biomass shall be utilized for commercial purposes.","555914722fff42eeb7e173ff7181374d","","eng","naver"

For this purpose, the geopolymer specimens were immersed in water for 30 days to measure changes in microstructure and alkalinity of the immersion liquid. Particularly, the experiment was carried out with foaming status of the geopolymers and parameters of room temperature aging condition, and immersion time. The foamed geopolymer containing 0.1 wt% Si-sludge had pores with a diameter of 1 to 3 mm and exhibited excellent foamability. Also, the calcium-silicate-hydrate crystal phase appeared in the foamed geopolymer. In the geopolymer immersion experiment, the pH of the immersion liquid increased with time, because the un-reacted alkali activator remained was dissolved in the immersion liquid. From the pH change of the immersion liquid, it was found that geopolymer reaction in the foamed specimen was completed faster than the non-foamed specimen. Through this study, it was possible to successfully produce foamed and non-foamed geopolymers recycled from IGCC coal ash. Also the necessary data for the safe application of IGCC coal ash-based geopolymers to areas where water resistance is needed were established; for example, the process conditions for room temperature aging time, effect of foaming status, immersion time and so on.","b927e00ee96f4b2cbb6c50aea7b05260","","eng","naver"

The effective diffusion coefficients of gas adsorbate were measured to be about $10^{-5}{\sim}10^{-4}cm^2/s$, and increased with temperature. As the pressure increased, the effective diffusion coefficients were decreased. The dependence of effective diffusion coefficients on temperature and pressure was greater in zeolite 13X particles than in activated carbon.

Alkaline-enhanced soil washing process increased the removal of lubricant oil up to 40%. This is because alkaline solution reduced the interfacial tension between water phase and lubricant oil phase due to the soap formation reaction. To simulate in-situ soil flushing for the remediation of railroad-related contamination, two dimensional soil flushing was carried out based on the results of batch soil washing.

Methods: In this study, zirconia block was dipped into $Fe(NO_3)_3$solution, which showed a color and then concentration of $Fe(NO_3)_3$and zirconia's color and physical properties depending on the dipping time were observed and compared with exclusive coloring solutions. As the result, the following conclusions were obtained. Results: When compared with the specimens that were colored using exclusive solutions, $L^*$ value rose overall depending on the concentration of $Fe(NO_3)_3$and $a^*$ value was red in the form of (+) in all the specimens. Also, $b^*$ value was in the form of (+) at 0.5 to $1{\ss}fl$, but was in the form of (-) at 1.5 to $2{\ss}fl$. The dipping time did not highly influence $L^*$ value, but $a^*$ value and $b^*$ value were directly opposite to the specimens, which were not colored, except the sample that was dipped for only 2 seconds. When compared with exclusive coloring solutions, $Fe(NO_3)_3$had the most similar color at 0.5 to $1{\ss}fl$ and the longer the coloring time, the higher the rate of color change became. In relation to the density change depending on the addition of $Fe(NO_3)_3$, there was the lowest density at $2{\ss}fl$ and the density was increased in the specimens that were not colored. Conclusion: These results show that $Fe(NO_3)_3$solution can be used to make colored zirconia. It is expected that newly made colored zirconia can be used in clinical practice because the colored zirconia not only possesses the mechanical properties that all ceramic core material should have but also was biocompatible to a living cells.","ce70d62d9d8a45d8973d4632df7e7dac","","eng","naver"

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","80498d4749bf45369d3ba43d74d44dea","","eng","naver"

Ocean dumping of the coastal dredged materials has become virtually prohibited as London Treaty will be enacted as of the year 2012. It will be necessary to treat and recycle the dredged materials that may carry organic pollutants and heavy metals in a reasonable and effective process: collection of the dredged materials, liquid and solid separation, and treatment of organic compounds and heavy metals. In this study we have developed a continuous bioreactor system that can treat a mixture of silt and particulate organic matter using a microbial consortium (BM-S-1). The steady-state operation conditions were: pH (7.4-7.5), temperature ($16^{\circ}C$), DO (7.5-7.9), and salt concentration (3.4-3.7%). The treatment efficiencies of SCOD, T-N and T-P of the mixture were 95-96%, 92-99%, and 79-97%. The system was also effective in removal of heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, and Cr. Levels of MLSS during three months operation period were 11,000-19,000 mg/L. Interestingly, there was little sludge generated during this period of operation. The augmented microbial consortium seemed to be quite active in the removal of the organic component (30%) present in the dredged material in association with indigenous bacteria. The dominant phyla in the treatment processes were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while dominant genii were Marinobacterium, Flaviramulus, Formosa, Alteromonadaceae_uc, Flavobacteriaceae_uc. These results will contribute to a development of a successful bioremediation technology for various coastal and river sediments with a high content of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and heavy metals, leading to a successful reuse of the polluted dredged sediments.","2fd7c0ac805d41cdbfdfc5276dda72ec","","eng","naver"

Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the performances of LID facilities in terms of runoff and pollutant reduction and also to provide an optimal maintenance method. The monitoring was conducted on four LID technologies (e.g., bioretention, small wetlands, rain garden and tree box filter). The optimal SA/CA (facility surface area / catchment area) ratio for runoff reduction greater than 40% is determined to be 1 - 5%. Since runoff reduction affects the pollutant removal efficiency in LID facilities, SA/CA ratio is derived as an important factor in designing LID facilities. The LID facilities that are found to be effective in reducing stormwater runoff are in the following order: rain garden > tree box filter > bioretention> small wetland. Meanwhile, in terms of removal of particulate matter (TSS), the effectiveness of the facilities are in the following order: rain garden > tree box filter > small wetland > bioretention; rain gardens > tree box filter > bioretention > small wetland were determined for the removal of organic matter (COD, TOC), nutrients (TN, TP) and heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn). These results can be used as an important material for the design of LID facilities in runoff volume and pollutant reduction.","b7d2cb34e4184ac695dbeda2e9173efd","","eng","naver"

The primary inoculums of ACR were symptomless strawberry plants, plant debris, and other host plants. To effectively control anthracnose in symptomless transplanted strawberries, it is necessary to use disease-free plants, detect the disease early, and apply a fungicide. Therefore, in 2010 and 2011, we evaluated the efficacy of pre-plant fungicide dips by using strawberry transplants infected by C. fructicola for the control of anthracnose. Dipping plants in prochloraz-Mn for 10 min before planting was most effective for controlling anthracnose in symptomless strawberry plants and resulted in more than 76% control efficacy. Azoxystrobin showed a control efficacy of over 40%, but plants treated with pyraclostrobin, mancozeb and iminoctadine tris showed high disease severity. The control efficacy of the dip treatment with prochloraz-Mn did not differ with temperature and time. Treatment with prochloraz-Mn for more than an hour caused growth suppression in strawberry plants. Therefore, the development of anthracnose can be effectively reduced by dipping strawberry plants for 10 min in prochloraz-Mn before planting.","d19da6567b0946b18157227f909f737c","","eng","naver"

Methods: The contact lens were prepared using HEMA(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and TRIM(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate) in a cast mold. Artificial tears containing lysozyme and albumin were prepared. We measured the amounts of protein adsorbed on the each lenses with varying adsorbed time (48 hour) and the pH range (6, 6.8, 7.4, 8.2, 9) of artificial tear. Amount of the proteins absorbed on the contact lenses were measured by using HPLC. Results: Time to reach the equilibrium of protein adsorption for silicone hydrogel lens was taken longer than hydrogel lens. The amount of adsorbed both lysozyme and albumin at equilibrium were greater for the hydrogel lens than the silicone hydrogel lens, and larger for the ionic lens than the non-ionic lens. Lysozyme was more adsorbed on the higher water content of contact lens, whereas albumin was more adsorbed on the lower water content of contact lens. Only lysozyme was adsorbed on the Group IV hydrogel lens of ionic higher water content. The adsorption of protein on contact lens increased with pH of artificial tears as close to the isoelectric point of each protein. Conclusions: The adsorption amount of lysozyme is more affected by the ionic strength of the contact lens surface than the water content of contact lens. Albumin adsorption is more affected by water content than the ionic strength of the contact lens surface. For the adsorption of proteins on the silicone hydrogel lens, the pore size, determined both by the number of Si atoms and the chemical structure of the silicone-containing monomers, as well as the polarity of contact lens should be also considered.","ae9d7fd3cba84b139612cf66de1620c9","","eng","naver"

The optimum materials, concentration and soaking time were examined to identify the effective approach to induce tetraploid plant by colchicine treatment to cultivate the varieties. For the seed germination rate of seed by colchicine treatment, the higher colchicine concentration was and the longer soaking time was, the more the germination rate decreased. While individuals were germinated in 16 test groups except control group (no treatment group), all the plants were diploid and no tetraploid was induced. For the plant regeneration rate by colchicine treatment on the explant of Hypericum patulum Thunberg that was under in vitro culture, the higher the colchicine concentration increased, the ress the regeneration rate. While total 147 individuals were regenerated in all treatment, when the explant was soaking treatment in more than 0.05% for over 6 hours, tetraploid could be obtained. In the soaking treatment of 0.05% for over 6 hours, tetraploid could be obtained. In particular, for the soaking treatment in 0.05% for 12 hours, 8 tetraploids were induced, which was about 47.1% of the number of plant regenerated. In accordance with the observation on doubling of DNA contents in leaf in order to identify polyploidy, the peak DNA content of G1 phase was 94.5 for diploid and 192.5 for tetraploid. It confirmed doubling of DNA content. Furthermore, the number of chloroplasts per guard cell depending on polyploid was around 10 in diploid and 17 to 19 in tetraploid, which were around 1.7 to 1.9 times as much as diploid.","d952d2bf72bf4f1d8a20a5edd828f56f","","eng","naver"

Bioaugmentation of a microbial consortium was proposed as an effective and economical restoration technology to restore the polluted stream. The microbial consortium activated on site was augmented on a periodic basis (7~10 days) into the most polluted site (Site 2) which was chosen considering the pollution level and tidal movement. Physicochemical parameters of water qualities were monitored including pH, temperature, DO, ORP, SS, COD, T-N, and T-P. COD and microbial community analyses of the sediments were also performed. A significant reduction in SS, COD, T-N, and COD (sediment) at Site 2 occurred showing their removal rates 51%, 58% and 27% and 35%, respectively, in 13 months while T-P increased by 47%. In most of the test sites, population densities of sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) groups (Desulfobacteraceae_uc_s, Desulfobacterales_uc_s, Desulfuromonadaceae_uc_s, Desulfuromonas_g1_uc, and Desulfobacter postgatei) and Anaerolinaeles was observed to generally decrease after the bioaugmentation while those of Gamma-proteobacteria (NOR5-6B_s and NOR5-6A_s), Bacteroidales_uc_s, and Flavobacteriales_uc_s appeared to generally increase. Aerobic microbial communities (Flavobacteriaceae_uc_s) were dominant in St. 4 that showed the highest level of DO and least level of COD. These microbial communities could be used as an indicator organism to monitor the restoration process. The alpha diversity indices (OTUs, Chao1, and Shannon) of microbial communities generally decreased after the augmentation. Fast uniFrac analysis of all the samples of different sites and dates showed that there was a similarity in the microbial community structures regardless of samples as the augmentation advanced in comparison with before- and early bioaugmentation event, indicating occurrence of changing of the indigenous microbial community structures. It was concluded that the bioaugmentation could improve the polluted water quality and simultaneously change the microbial community structures via their niche changes. This in situ remediation technology will contribute to an eco-friendly and economically cleaning up of polluted streams of brine water and freshwater.","1e9fc75c5e23431ca79f292493e02ba4","","eng","naver"

Even though the chemical criteria are satisfied, the treated sediment could still impose toxic effects. Therefore, this study investigated the changes in the ecological toxic effects of the contaminated sediment from the J region in Singapore after treatment. The contaminated sediment was subject to sequential soil washing and thermal treatment, followed by pH neutralization. Toxic effects of the contaminated and treated sediments were determined by using Vibrio fischeri ($Microtox^{(R)}$), Triticum aestivum (wheat), and Eisenia foetida (earthworm). After treatment, the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals were decreased by 98% and 59-93%, respectively, and satisfied the Industrial Maximum Values of the Dutch Standard, which were used as the remedial goal. The bioluminescence reduction of V. fischeri decreased significantly, and the earthworm survival increased from 0% to 90% after treatment. The germination rate increased from $0{\pm}0%$ to $75{\pm}13%$ after treatment, but the treated sediment may need additional treatment such as nutrient addition for better plant growth. Overall, this study showed that the treatment of the contaminated sediment satisfactorily removed mixed contaminants, and this led to reduction in toxic effects, suggesting improved potentials for reuse of the treated sediment.","f9131b091fe74fc0ab2ea96e6d0354c1","","eng","naver"

The simulated results from the watershed modeling program will be used to calculate the point and nonpoint sources pollutants of the future urban development scenarios. The amount of suspended sediments resulting from the urban developments and rainfall intensities will be used to indicate the environmental impacts of the water body between upstream and downstream.

Gas adsorption was studied in the pressure range of 50 to 500 kPa for $CO_2$, $N_2$, $O_2$ and $H_2$. It was evident that RHO zeolite showed a strong $CO_2$ adsorption behavior. Especially, RHO zeolite showed a transient $CO_2$ adsorption behavior. The 3h $CO_2$ up-take at 50 kPa and 500 kPa was 1.283 and 3.357 mmol/g, respectively. The $CO_2/H_2$ selectivity was around 16 at 500 kPa.

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","58ba6262ef544c54bd62ac1d85b2fb35","","eng","naver"

There are many disposal methods to remove odor, but there are many disadvantages and inadequate applications. The Purpose of this study was to develop a bag-filer system for odor removal using powder adsorbent. Methods: The bag-filter system is composed of a shear bag filter, an absorbent spraying system and an absorbent circulation system. The spraying absorbent system was connected with the inlet duct of the shear bag filter for inputting adsorbent. And the absorbent circulation system can transport the collecting adsorbent from hoper to the inlet duct of the system. As a result, the adsorbent can remove odor with recycling in the system. Also affective factors like the powdered absorbent combination and injection method was researched for maximization of system efficiency. The study was conducted in two stages. The first step was testing equipment made and the second is to evaluate the efficiency of the odor control by connecting to the actual odor generation process. Results: Both experiment stages showed efficient odor control ability. The adsorption efficiency of the system is demonstrated and the odor was adsorbed well by the powder adsorbent. It is essential to accurately understand the characteristics of the odorous and use the appropriate adsorbent. Although the powder adsorbent was used in the experiment, the problem of scattering did not occur due to the high degree of system sealing. Also the system manufactured in this study was designed to recycle the adsorbent, so adsorbent reuse or batch processing is convenient. Conclusions: The applicability of the system has been proven through this research. Customized systems for industrial process and the appropriate adsorbent base on the characteristics of pollutant generation will show efficient odor collection ability.","12499520f3ff420098c42836f2da79cd","","eng","naver"

The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) has certain advantages over the other methods, such as absorption and membrane, that are a low energy requirement and cost-effectiveness. A key component of PSA systems is adsorbents that should be highly selective to a gas being separated from its mixture streams and have isotherms suitable for the operation principle. The six standard types of isotherms have been examined in this review, and among them the best behavior in the adsorption of $CO_2$ as a function of pressure was proposed in aspects of maximizing a working capacity upon excursion between adsorption and desorption cycles. Zeolites and molecular sieves are historically typical adsorbents for such PSA applications in gas and related industries, and their physicochemical features, e.g., framework, channel structure, pore size, Si-to-Al ratio (SAR), and specific surface area, are strongly associated with the extent of $CO_2$ adsorption at given conditions and those points have been extensively described with literature data.

The optimal adsorption temperature, adsorption time, solvent type, and crude extract/Sylopute ratio were $30^{\circ}C$, 15 min, methylene chloride, and 1:1(w/w), respectively. This result could be confirmed by HPLC analysis of the absorbent after treatment and TGA of the organic substances that were bound to the adsorbent. In adsorbent treatment step, the purity seemed to show a small improvement but this treatment had a significant effect on convenience and feasibility of following steps by the removal of tar and waxy compounds.","faef3ffe1e8b402a9535975399031013","","eng","naver"

The energy slab is installed as one component of the floor slab layers in order to utilize the underground structure as a hybrid energy structure.

Therefore, stainless steel (STS) pipes are alternatively considered as a heat exchanger instead of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes in order to enhance thermal performance of GHEXs. Moreover, not only a floor slab but also a wall slab can be utilized as a heat-exchangeable energy slab in order to maximize the use of underground space effectively.

Conclusion: These results show that $Fe(NO_3)_3$solution can be used to make colored zirconia. It is expected that newly made colored zirconia can be used in clinical practice because the colored zirconia not only possesses the mechanical properties that all ceramic core material should have but also was biocompatible to a living cells.","764a284db9424892a0e7c277170d8bf2","","eng","naver"

The efficiency of sewage treatment according to the sewage loading was investigated to obtain the optimum sewage loading in small-scale sewage treatment apparatus. Removal rate of pollutants according to the sewage loading were in the order of $150\;Lm^{-2}day^{-1}{\fallingdotseq}300\;Lm^{-2}day^{-1}>600\;Lm^{-2}day^{-1}$. Therefore, the optimum sewage loading was 300 L m-2 day-1. Under the optimum sewage loading, removal rate of BOD, $COD_{Mn}$, turbidity, T-N and T-P were 99, 94, 99, 49 and 89%, respectively. However, to satisfy the water quality standard in effluent in small-sclae sewage treatment apparatus for domestic sewage treatment, the low removal efficiency of T-N and T-P must be improved. So to improve the removal rate of T-N and T-P, the efficiency of sewage treatment according to the improved sewage treatment process such as, re-treatment at aerobic plot, anaerobic condition of aerobic plot, changing the filter media sizes and the depths in anaerobic plot, and also addition of oyster shells to filter media at anaerobic plot were investigated. In case of 150 cm depth in anaerobic plot with filter medium A (effectivity particle size 1.50 mm) and addition of oyster shells to filter media at anaerobic plot, removal rate of T-N and T-P in both plots were increased by 10 and 3%, and 14 and 7% in comparison with 100 cm depth in anaerobic plot with filter medium B(effectivity particle size 0.95 mm), respectively. The optimum improved sewage treatment process in small-scale sewage treatment apparatus were 150 cm depth in anaerobic plot with filter medium A and addition of oyster shells to filter media at anaerobic plot.","6270407a6d4e49c18f0ca2f7965875ec","","eng","naver"

The usual operating conditions are adsorption temperatures of $15{\sim}40^{\circ}C$ and adsorption pressures of 4~6 bar based on numerous PSA processes which are widely employed in gases industry for adsorptive separation of $CO_2$. The extent of $CO_2$ adsorption on the microporous materials depends on the metal species and organic linkers existing in the frameworks. The pore size and the surface area, and the process variables are the key parameters to be associated with the efficiency of the adsorbents, particularly adsorption pressures if other variables are comparable each other. The MOFs and ZIFs materials require high pressures greater than 15 bar to yield significant $CO_2$ uptakes. They possess a $CO_2$ adsorption capacity which is very similar to or less than that of conventional benchmark adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons. Consequently, those materials have been much less cost-effective for adsorptive $CO_2$ separation to date because of very high production price and the absence of commercially-proven PSA processes using such new adsorbents.","94ff6634eb294f058db55af7f898ec09","","eng","naver"

Ocean dumping of the coastal dredged materials has become virtually prohibited as London Treaty will be enacted as of the year 2012. It will be necessary to treat and recycle the dredged materials that may carry organic pollutants and heavy metals in a reasonable and effective process: collection of the dredged materials, liquid and solid separation, and treatment of organic compounds and heavy metals. In this study we have developed a continuous bioreactor system that can treat a mixture of silt and particulate organic matter using a microbial consortium (BM-S-1). The steady-state operation conditions were: pH (7.4-7.5), temperature ($16^{\circ}C$), DO (7.5-7.9), and salt concentration (3.4-3.7%). The treatment efficiencies of SCOD, T-N and T-P of the mixture were 95-96%, 92-99%, and 79-97%. The system was also effective in removal of heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, and Cr. Levels of MLSS during three months operation period were 11,000-19,000 mg/L. Interestingly, there was little sludge generated during this period of operation. The augmented microbial consortium seemed to be quite active in the removal of the organic component (30%) present in the dredged material in association with indigenous bacteria. The dominant phyla in the treatment processes were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while dominant genii were Marinobacterium, Flaviramulus, Formosa, Alteromonadaceae_uc, Flavobacteriaceae_uc. These results will contribute to a development of a successful bioremediation technology for various coastal and river sediments with a high content of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and heavy metals, leading to a successful reuse of the polluted dredged sediments.","b58169151f5e4bf5b0e0b5d50c67eb2e","","eng","naver"

Equilibrium sorption data were described well by Freundlich isotherm model. The influence of initial solution pH on $Cr^{6+}$ adsorption was insignificant.

While the R. sachalinensis extract (RSE), which did not go through the adsorption process, showed little change in pH during fermentation and a significant reduction in the number of lactic acid bacteria, the pre-preparatory adsorption process was found to be helpful for promoting fermentation and for maintenance of bacterial numbers. The contents of total phenolic compounds mostly decreased during the adsorption process, but showed an increasing tendency to rebound during the fermentation process. The contents of salidroside and p-tyrosol in the RSE were 1153.3 mg% and 185.0 mg% respectively, and they did not significantly change after treatment with acid clay or bentonite as adsorbents, which were 1093.0 and 190.5 mg% by acid clay, and 882.2 and 157.3 mg% by bentonite. When the extract was fermented after treatment with acid clay or bentonite, the salidroside contents were decreased by 282.7 and 505.0 mg% respectively, but the p-tyrosol contents were increased by 714.0 and 522.4 mg% respectively.

And the removal efficiency of copper using nanobubble water(NBW) and distilled water(DW) were compared and analyzed through a batch desorption test. As a result, it is confirmed that nanobubble which was fabricated by compression-dissolution type generator can exist for more than 14 days. The results of batch test show that copper removal of NBW was higher than that of DW irrespectively to soil type and increased as solid-liquid ratio and contact time increased, respectively. According to the pH change, the removal of copper on sand was higher on the acid side but the removal difference was slightly lower on the clay. It is considered that a high efficiency of NBW in copper removal is due to the large surface area and high zeta-potential of nanobubbles.

Bioaugmentation of a microbial consortium was proposed as an effective and economical restoration technology to restore the polluted stream. The microbial consortium activated on site was augmented on a periodic basis (7~10 days) into the most polluted site (Site 2) which was chosen considering the pollution level and tidal movement. Physicochemical parameters of water qualities were monitored including pH, temperature, DO, ORP, SS, COD, T-N, and T-P. COD and microbial community analyses of the sediments were also performed. A significant reduction in SS, COD, T-N, and COD (sediment) at Site 2 occurred showing their removal rates 51%, 58% and 27% and 35%, respectively, in 13 months while T-P increased by 47%. In most of the test sites, population densities of sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) groups (Desulfobacteraceae_uc_s, Desulfobacterales_uc_s, Desulfuromonadaceae_uc_s, Desulfuromonas_g1_uc, and Desulfobacter postgatei) and Anaerolinaeles was observed to generally decrease after the bioaugmentation while those of Gamma-proteobacteria (NOR5-6B_s and NOR5-6A_s), Bacteroidales_uc_s, and Flavobacteriales_uc_s appeared to generally increase. Aerobic microbial communities (Flavobacteriaceae_uc_s) were dominant in St. 4 that showed the highest level of DO and least level of COD. These microbial communities could be used as an indicator organism to monitor the restoration process.

Fast uniFrac analysis of all the samples of different sites and dates showed that there was a similarity in the microbial community structures regardless of samples as the augmentation advanced in comparison with before- and early bioaugmentation event, indicating occurrence of changing of the indigenous microbial community structures. It was concluded that the bioaugmentation could improve the polluted water quality and simultaneously change the microbial community structures via their niche changes.

The investigated process parameters were separation coefficient, rate constant, rate controlling step, activation energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy. The adsorption of RO 16 was the highest at pH 3 due to the electrostatic attraction between the cations (H+) on the surface of the activated carbon and the sulfonate ions and hydroxy ions possessed by RO 16. Isotherm data were fitted into Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models by applying the evaluated separation factor of Langmuir (RL=0.459~0.491) and Freundlich (1/n=0.398~0.441). Therefore, the adsorption operation of RO 16 by activated carbon was confirmed as an appropriate removal method. Temkin's adsorption energy indicated that this adsorption process was physical adsorption. The adsorption kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of RO 16 follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and that the rate controlling step in the adsorption process was the intraparticle diffusion step. The positive enthalpy change indicated an endothermic process. The negative Gibbs free energy change decreased in the order of -3.16 <-11.60 <-14.01 kJ/mol as the temperature increased.

Due to the increase in impervious surface by urbanization, developed countries apply low impact development (LID) techniques as important alternatives to reduce the impacts of urbanization. In Korea, LID techniques were employed since 2012 in order to manage nonpoint source pollutants. LID technology is a technique for removing pollutants using a variety of physical, chemical and biological mechanisms in plants, microorganisms and filter media with the reduced effluence of stormwater runoff by mimicking natural water circulation system. These LID facilities are used in a variety of filter media, but an assessment has not been carried out for the comprehensive comparison evaluation of adsorption and desorption characteristics for the pollutant removal capacity. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the adsorption and desorption characteristics of various filter media used in the LID facilities such as sand, gravel, bioceramic, wood chips and bottom ash etc. in reducing heavy metals(Pb, Cu). In this study, the adsorption affinity for Pb in all filter media was higher than Cu.

Bioaugmentation of a microbial consortium was proposed as an effective and economical restoration technology to restore the polluted stream. The microbial consortium activated on site was augmented on a periodic basis (7~10 days) into the most polluted site (Site 2) which was chosen considering the pollution level and tidal movement. Physicochemical parameters of water qualities were monitored including pH, temperature, DO, ORP, SS, COD, T-N, and T-P. COD and microbial community analyses of the sediments were also performed. A significant reduction in SS, COD, T-N, and COD (sediment) at Site 2 occurred showing their removal rates 51%, 58% and 27% and 35%, respectively, in 13 months while T-P increased by 47%. In most of the test sites, population densities of sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) groups (Desulfobacteraceae_uc_s, Desulfobacterales_uc_s, Desulfuromonadaceae_uc_s, Desulfuromonas_g1_uc, and Desulfobacter postgatei) and Anaerolinaeles was observed to generally decrease after the bioaugmentation while those of Gamma-proteobacteria (NOR5-6B_s and NOR5-6A_s), Bacteroidales_uc_s, and Flavobacteriales_uc_s appeared to generally increase. Aerobic microbial communities (Flavobacteriaceae_uc_s) were dominant in St. 4 that showed the highest level of DO and least level of COD.

The alpha diversity indices (OTUs, Chao1, and Shannon) of microbial communities generally decreased after the augmentation. Fast uniFrac analysis of all the samples of different sites and dates showed that there was a similarity in the microbial community structures regardless of samples as the augmentation advanced in comparison with before- and early bioaugmentation event, indicating occurrence of changing of the indigenous microbial community structures. It was concluded that the bioaugmentation could improve the polluted water quality and simultaneously change the microbial community structures via their niche changes.

For this reason, the specific surface area (SSA) of the ACFs decreased with much more physical and chemical etching. In particular, the SSA of the sample (A-O60) injected with an oxygen gas flow rate of 60 sccm was reduced to about $1.198m^2/g$, which was about 6.95% lower than that of the untreated samples. On the other hand, the oxygen content introduced into the surface of ACFs increased up to 35.87%. Also, the adsorption performance on the acetic acid gas of the oxygen plasma-treated ACFs was improved by up to 43% compared to that of using the untreated ACFs. It is attributed to the formation of the hydrogen bonding due to the dipole moments between acetic acid molecules and oxygen functional groups such as O=C-O introduced by the oxygen plasma treatment.","d2f9e3e104b2466087e0a7e6e9c3d3e6","","eng","naver"

In excess, however, these elements can limit plant growth. This study selected a heavy metal-tolerant plant by analyzing seed germination and biomass of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), canola (Brassica campestris subsp. napus var. nippo-oleifera), Chinese corn (Setaria italica), and a sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor ${\times}$ S. sudanense), and determined heavy metal uptake capacity by analyzing biomass, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and heavy metal contents under high external copper or zinc levels. The seed germination rate and biomass of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid were higher under copper or zinc stress compared to the other three plants. The plant biomass and photosynthetic pigment contents of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid seedlings were less vulnerable under low levels of heavy metals (${\leq}50ppm$ copper or ${\leq}400ppm$ zinc). The maximum quantum yield of PSII ($F_v/F_m$) and the maximum primary yield of PSII ($F_v/F_o$) decreased with increasing copper or zinc levels. Under high copper levels, the decline in $F_v/F_m$ was caused only by the decline in $F_m$, and was accompanied by an increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The $F_v/F_m$ declined under high levels of zinc due to both a decrease in the maximum fluorescence ($F_m$) and an increase in the initial fluorescence ($F_o$), and this was accompanied by a marked decrease in photochemical quenching (qP), but not by an increase in NPQ. Accumulations of copper and zinc were found in both aboveand below-ground parts of plants, but were greater in the below-ground parts. The uptake capacity of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid for copper and zinc reached 4459.1 mg/kg under 400 ppm copper and 9028.5 mg/kg under 1600 ppm zinc. Our results indicate that the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid contributes to the in situ phytoremediation of copper or zinc polluted soils due to its high biomass yield.","f64b4e44e2fb4b5c8514693124cd7858","","eng","naver"

In order to develop a technology for the reduction of polymer binders, smooth and spherical aggregates were prepared by the atomizing technology using the oxidation process steel slag (electric arc furnace slag, EAFS) and the reduction process steel slag (ladle furnace slag, LFS) generated by steel industries. A reduction in the amount of polymer binders used was expected because of an improvement in the workability of polymer concretes as a result of the ball-bearing effect and maximum filling effect in case the polymer concrete was prepared using the smooth and spherical atomized steel slag instead of the calcium carbonate (filler) and river sand (fine aggregate) that were generally used in polymer concretes. To investigate physical properties of the polymer concrete, specimens of the polymer concrete were prepared with various proportions of polymer binder and replacement ratios of the atomized reduction process steel slag. The results showed that the compressive strengths of the specimens increased gradually along with the higher replacement ratios of the atomized steel slag, but the flexural strength showed a different maximum strength depending on the addition ratio of polymer binders. In the hot water resistance test, the compressive strength, flexural strength, bulk density, and average pore diameter decreased; but the total pore volume and porosity increased. It was found that the polymer concrete developed in this study was able to have a 19% reduction in the amount of polymer binders compared with that of the conventional product because of the remarkable improvement in the workability of polymer concretes using the spherical atomized oxidation steel slag and atomized reduction steel slag instead of the calcium carbonate and river sand.","5f572a73595b42828d21fc15c7fd77c2","","eng","naver"

Emulsified refining cooking oil(ERCO) was made by mixing WCO and emulsifying agent to improve fluidity. ERCO was replaced by cement from 0.25 to 1.0%. As results, the increase of ERCO resulted in decrease of slump and air contents. For compressive strength, the use of ERCO led to decrease the compressive strength at 28 days, while it had similar strength or much higher strength than plain concrete at 180 days. Resistance to carbonation and chloride penetration was improved with the increase of ERCO contents due to decreased pore distribution by saponification between ERCO and concrete, while freeze-thaw resistance was degraded due to air loss.","788b222d2be64ed2814321b0db1895b3","","eng","naver"

However, under actual field conditions that are not at the optimum temperature, degradation of microorganisms is generally reduced, which is why the efficiency of biodegradation is known to be significantly affected by the soil temperature. Therefore, in this study, the labscale experiment was conducted using indigenous crude oil degrading microorganisms isolated from crude oil contaminated site to evaluate the remediation efficiency. Crude oil degrading microorganisms were isolated from crude oil contaminated soil and temperature, which is a significant factor affecting the remediation efficiency of land farming, was adjusted to evaluate the microbial crude oil degrading ability, degradation time, and remediation efficiency. In order to assess the field applicability, the remediation efficiency was evaluated using crude oil contaminated soil (average TPH concentration of 10,000 mg/kg or more) from the OO premises. Followed by the application of microorganisms at 30℃, the bioremediation process reduced its initial TPH concentration of 10,812 mg/kg down to 1,890 mg/kg in 56 days, which was about an 83% remediation efficiency. By analyzing the correlation among the total number of cells, the number of effective cells, and TPH concentration, it was found that the number of effective microorganisms drastically increased during the period from 10 to 20 days while there was a sharp decrease in TPH concentration. Therefore, we confirmed the applicability of land farming with isolated microorganisms consortium to crude oil contaminated site, which is also expected to be applicable to bioremediation of other recalcitrant materials.","3c0ea1103a834205b9bf8affcc71c599","","eng","naver"

Effects of the polymerization temperature, polymerization time, Al/Ni molar ratio, and type of co-catalyst on norbornene polymerization were investigated. Unsupported late transition metal catalysts did not show any activities for norbornene polymerization. However, the $SiO_2$/2NS/Ni catayst with MAO system, with increasing polymerization temperature, increased the polymerization activity and decreased the molecular weight of the polynorbornene (PNB). Furthermore, the catalyst when increasing polymerization temperature caused the decrease in both the polymerization activity and molecular weight of PNB. This confirmed that the stability of $SiO_2$/2NS/Ni at a high temperature was greater than that of $SiO_2$/2NS/Pd. Also the longer polymerization time resulted in the higher conversion of norbornene for both catalysts.

Many researches have focused on developing the breakthrough adsorbent to increase the cesium removal efficiency in water. In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","0954cbe10c0d4e0fb4749b3dd416e501","","eng","naver"

In order to develop a technology for the reduction of polymer binders, smooth and spherical aggregates were prepared by the atomizing technology using the oxidation process steel slag (electric arc furnace slag, EAFS) and the reduction process steel slag (ladle furnace slag, LFS) generated by steel industries. A reduction in the amount of polymer binders used was expected because of an improvement in the workability of polymer concretes as a result of the ball-bearing effect and maximum filling effect in case the polymer concrete was prepared using the smooth and spherical atomized steel slag instead of the calcium carbonate (filler) and river sand (fine aggregate) that were generally used in polymer concretes. To investigate physical properties of the polymer concrete, specimens of the polymer concrete were prepared with various proportions of polymer binder and replacement ratios of the atomized reduction process steel slag. The results showed that the compressive strengths of the specimens increased gradually along with the higher replacement ratios of the atomized steel slag, but the flexural strength showed a different maximum strength depending on the addition ratio of polymer binders. In the hot water resistance test, the compressive strength, flexural strength, bulk density, and average pore diameter decreased; but the total pore volume and porosity increased. It was found that the polymer concrete developed in this study was able to have a 19% reduction in the amount of polymer binders compared with that of the conventional product because of the remarkable improvement in the workability of polymer concretes using the spherical atomized oxidation steel slag and atomized reduction steel slag instead of the calcium carbonate and river sand.","b23d973cc5e94cbaaa0630c265396ed5","","eng","naver"

In excess, however, these elements can limit plant growth. This study selected a heavy metal-tolerant plant by analyzing seed germination and biomass of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), canola (Brassica campestris subsp. napus var. nippo-oleifera), Chinese corn (Setaria italica), and a sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor ${\times}$ S. sudanense), and determined heavy metal uptake capacity by analyzing biomass, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and heavy metal contents under high external copper or zinc levels. The seed germination rate and biomass of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid were higher under copper or zinc stress compared to the other three plants. The plant biomass and photosynthetic pigment contents of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid seedlings were less vulnerable under low levels of heavy metals (${\leq}50ppm$ copper or ${\leq}400ppm$ zinc). The maximum quantum yield of PSII ($F_v/F_m$) and the maximum primary yield of PSII ($F_v/F_o$) decreased with increasing copper or zinc levels. Under high copper levels, the decline in $F_v/F_m$ was caused only by the decline in $F_m$, and was accompanied by an increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The $F_v/F_m$ declined under high levels of zinc due to both a decrease in the maximum fluorescence ($F_m$) and an increase in the initial fluorescence ($F_o$), and this was accompanied by a marked decrease in photochemical quenching (qP), but not by an increase in NPQ. Accumulations of copper and zinc were found in both aboveand below-ground parts of plants, but were greater in the below-ground parts. The uptake capacity of the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid for copper and zinc reached 4459.1 mg/kg under 400 ppm copper and 9028.5 mg/kg under 1600 ppm zinc. Our results indicate that the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid contributes to the in situ phytoremediation of copper or zinc polluted soils due to its high biomass yield.","8ae2064148384440882ad1d4c9025a37","","eng","naver"

Ocean dumping of the coastal dredged materials has become virtually prohibited as London Treaty will be enacted as of the year 2012. It will be necessary to treat and recycle the dredged materials that may carry organic pollutants and heavy metals in a reasonable and effective process: collection of the dredged materials, liquid and solid separation, and treatment of organic compounds and heavy metals. In this study we have developed a continuous bioreactor system that can treat a mixture of silt and particulate organic matter using a microbial consortium (BM-S-1). The steady-state operation conditions were: pH (7.4-7.5), temperature ($16^{\circ}C$), DO (7.5-7.9), and salt concentration (3.4-3.7%). The treatment efficiencies of SCOD, T-N and T-P of the mixture were 95-96%, 92-99%, and 79-97%. The system was also effective in removal of heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, and Cr. Levels of MLSS during three months operation period were 11,000-19,000 mg/L. Interestingly, there was little sludge generated during this period of operation. The augmented microbial consortium seemed to be quite active in the removal of the organic component (30%) present in the dredged material in association with indigenous bacteria. The dominant phyla in the treatment processes were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while dominant genii were Marinobacterium, Flaviramulus, Formosa, Alteromonadaceae_uc, Flavobacteriaceae_uc. These results will contribute to a development of a successful bioremediation technology for various coastal and river sediments with a high content of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and heavy metals, leading to a successful reuse of the polluted dredged sediments.","6d9082b4111940dfb1e4e79b8800e0f4","","eng","naver"

Toxic effects of the contaminated and treated sediments were determined by using Vibrio fischeri ($Microtox^{(R)}$), Triticum aestivum (wheat), and Eisenia foetida (earthworm). After treatment, the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals were decreased by 98% and 59-93%, respectively, and satisfied the Industrial Maximum Values of the Dutch Standard, which were used as the remedial goal. The bioluminescence reduction of V. fischeri decreased significantly, and the earthworm survival increased from 0% to 90% after treatment. The germination rate increased from $0{\pm}0%$ to $75{\pm}13%$ after treatment, but the treated sediment may need additional treatment such as nutrient addition for better plant growth.

Carbon particles were mostly porous and have a turbostratic structure. When 1g of carbon was activated with 6g of KOH powder, the highest specific surface area value of $670m^2/g$ was achieved. Low wettability of unburned carbon particles, which was resulted from high temperature combustion in a boiler, might cause poor pore formation when they were activated by KOH solution. The activated carbon produced in this study developed micropores, with an equivalent quality of general-purpose activated carbon made from coal. Hence, it is concluded that chemically treated unburned carbon can be used for water purification or an alternative to carbon black as it is.","da2b7531341e4ddcb7a9ecfcfd80a204","","eng","naver"

Bioaugmentation of a microbial consortium was proposed as an effective and economical restoration technology to restore the polluted stream. The microbial consortium activated on site was augmented on a periodic basis (7~10 days) into the most polluted site (Site 2) which was chosen considering the pollution level and tidal movement. Physicochemical parameters of water qualities were monitored including pH, temperature, DO, ORP, SS, COD, T-N, and T-P. COD and microbial community analyses of the sediments were also performed. A significant reduction in SS, COD, T-N, and COD (sediment) at Site 2 occurred showing their removal rates 51%, 58% and 27% and 35%, respectively, in 13 months while T-P increased by 47%. In most of the test sites, population densities of sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) groups (Desulfobacteraceae_uc_s, Desulfobacterales_uc_s, Desulfuromonadaceae_uc_s, Desulfuromonas_g1_uc, and Desulfobacter postgatei) and Anaerolinaeles was observed to generally decrease after the bioaugmentation while those of Gamma-proteobacteria (NOR5-6B_s and NOR5-6A_s), Bacteroidales_uc_s, and Flavobacteriales_uc_s appeared to generally increase. Aerobic microbial communities (Flavobacteriaceae_uc_s) were dominant in St. 4 that showed the highest level of DO and least level of COD. These microbial communities could be used as an indicator organism to monitor the restoration process. The alpha diversity indices (OTUs, Chao1, and Shannon) of microbial communities generally decreased after the augmentation. Fast uniFrac analysis of all the samples of different sites and dates showed that there was a similarity in the microbial community structures regardless of samples as the augmentation advanced in comparison with before- and early bioaugmentation event, indicating occurrence of changing of the indigenous microbial community structures. It was concluded that the bioaugmentation could improve the polluted water quality and simultaneously change the microbial community structures via their niche changes. This in situ remediation technology will contribute to an eco-friendly and economically cleaning up of polluted streams of brine water and freshwater.","267f68f189db4156baae281e30b08b34","","eng","naver"

In order to resolve such problems, a rainwater reservoir can be an effective and useful solution. The rainwater reservoir facilitates the hydrologic cycle in urban areas by temporarily retaining precipitation-runoff within a shallow subsurface layer for later use in a dry season. However, in order to use the stored water of precipitation-runoff, non-point source pollutants mostly retained in initial rainfall should be removed before being stored in the reservoir. Therefore, the purification system to filter out the non-point source pollutants is essential for the rainwater reservoir. The conventional soil filtration technology is well known to be able to capture non-point source pollutants in a economical and efficient way. This study adopted a sand filter layer (SFL) as a non-point source pollutant removal system in the rainwater reservoir, and conducted a series of lab-scale chamber tests and field tests to evaluate the pollutant removal efficiency and applicability of SFL. During the laboratory chamber experiments, three types of SFL with the different grain size characteristics were compared in the chamber with a dimension of $20cm{\times}30cm{\times}60cm$. To evaluate performance of the reservoir systems, the concentration of the polluted water in terms of TSS (Total Suspended Solids) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) were measured and compared.

However, since the use of atomizing reduction steel slag decreased the resistance of the polymer concrete to hot water, further studies are required.","7af675e7a74d4b5d8eaf706d63455c62","","eng","naver"

In this study, its properties as an adsorbent were examined and also adsorption of arsenic onto hematite was characterized as well. The specific surface area of hematite synthesized in our laboratory appeared to be $31.8g\;m^2/g$ and its point of zero salt effect, (PZSE) determined by potentiometric titration was observed 8.5. These features of hematite may contribute to high capacity of arsenic adsorption. From several adsorption experiments undertaken at the identical solution concentrations over pH 2~12, the adsorption of As(III) (arsenite) was greater than that of As(V) (arsenate). As of pH-dependent adsorption patterns, in addition, arsenite adsorption gradually increased until pH 9.2 and then sharply decreased with pH, whereas adsorption of arsenate was greatest at pH 2.0 and steadily decreased with the increasing pH from 2 to 12. The characteristics of these pH-dependent adsorption patterns might be caused by combined effects of the variation in the chemical speciation of arsenic and the surface charge of hematite. The experimental results on adsorption kinetics show that adsorption of both arsenic species onto hematite approached equilibrium within 20 h. Additionally, the pseudo-second-order model was evaluated to be the best fit for the adsorption kinetics of arsenic onto hematite, regardless of arsenic species, and the rate constant of As(V) adsorption was investigated to be larger than that of As(III).","8d1a8044ae7948c19dfa9618bb7155ce","","eng","naver"

Many researches have focused on developing the breakthrough adsorbent to increase the cesium removal efficiency in water. In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","acb60a8000b0496cb5b5ed647e017638","","eng","naver"

Polluted ballast gravel was put into this device for cleaning, with the treatment time varied from 1 to 10 min. The cleaning efficiency of the total petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals were studied. The total petroleum hydrocarbon removal efficiency was 70-80% for gravels sampled from a locomotive waiting line, while it was 40-60% for gravels sampled from a turnout area. The heavy metal removal efficiency exceeded 90% for copper and lead, while it was 65-80% for nickel and zinc.

This treatment system was more efficient than the seawater pumping system under similar treatment conditions (by 40%). By the way, little oil degrader communities were observed despite a potential function of the air jet system to stimulate aerobic oil degraders. The apparent low population density of the oil degraders might be as a result of low concentration of TPH as a carbon source and limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.

Many researches have focused on developing the breakthrough adsorbent to increase the cesium removal efficiency in water. In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","fd3169c104fc41a9ad9ab178f9ce85b6","","eng","naver"

The results showed that the temperature efficiencies of the two samples were approximately the same. The humidity efficiency, however, was strongly affected by the LiCl impregnation. The impregnated sample yielded a 9% higher humidity efficiency under cooling and the difference increased to 14% under aheating condition. It was anticipated that more moisture would beadsorbed on the LiCl-impregnated spacers, which was delivered to their roots and eventually to the air in neighboring channels. Separate moisture adsorption tests revealed that both the adsorption rate and the amount of the adsorbed moisture are higher for the LiCl-impregnated specimen.","b961048ea93749749ae11e192e8b6238","","eng","naver"

Many researches have focused on developing the breakthrough adsorbent to increase the cesium removal efficiency in water. In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","c462b5df60244e4aad252e7f0f84ac42","","eng","naver"

Montmorillonite amendment by 5% of soil mass resulted in TNT desorption of 0.12 mg/kg from soil loaded with 9.93 mg/kg-TNT.

The results showed that the metal removal efficiency with the exception of Cr decreased abruptly, even within 5 min, showing more than 90% removal. The pH of each reactant increased gradually from around 7 to 9 with time. The increases in metal removal at higher pH appear to be associated with metal hydroxides precipitation. Comparative experiments, which were carried out changing the pH by reacting with commercial activated carbon (CAC), natural yellow soil (NYS), and calcined yellow soil (CYS), showed that the pH of the CYS only increased with time.

In order to resolve such problems, a rainwater reservoir can be an effective and useful solution. The rainwater reservoir facilitates the hydrologic cycle in urban areas by temporarily retaining precipitation-runoff within a shallow subsurface layer for later use in a dry season. However, in order to use the stored water of precipitation-runoff, non-point source pollutants mostly retained in initial rainfall should be removed before being stored in the reservoir. Therefore, the purification system to filter out the non-point source pollutants is essential for the rainwater reservoir. The conventional soil filtration technology is well known to be able to capture non-point source pollutants in a economical and efficient way. This study adopted a sand filter layer (SFL) as a non-point source pollutant removal system in the rainwater reservoir, and conducted a series of lab-scale chamber tests and field tests to evaluate the pollutant removal efficiency and applicability of SFL. During the laboratory chamber experiments, three types of SFL with the different grain size characteristics were compared in the chamber with a dimension of $20cm{\times}30cm{\times}60cm$. To evaluate performance of the reservoir systems, the concentration of the polluted water in terms of TSS (Total Suspended Solids) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) were measured and compared. In addition, a reduction in hydraulic conductivity of SFL due to pollutant clogging was indirectly estimated. The optimum SFL selected through the laboratory chamber experiments was verified on the in-situ rainwater reservoir for field applicability.","8a929031f88842f5bf474c1c94b11fa2","","eng","naver"

The results that Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model are compared to the adsorption amount according to the change of the initial concentration by the contaminants. As a result of the component analysis, because Si, Al and O are contained approximately 28%, 11% and 48%, respectively, it is identified that the material coated on the surface of the drain is the component of the zeolite which is the reactant for the adsorption of the heavy-metal (Cu, Pb, Cd) contaminants. The heavy-metal adsorption kinetic of the zeolite which is the reactant was decreased in order of lead, copper and cadmium. The important factor of the performance evaluation of the adsorbent is the reaction rate, and if zeolite is used as the reactant in the relationship between the maximum amount of adsorption and reaction rate, it can be utilized as the design factor that determine the removal order of the complex heavy-metal. In other words, because the maximum adsorption quantity of lead is smaller compared to copper but the reaction rate is relatively fast, it can be primarily removed, and copper can be removed after removing the lead. It was analyzed that Cadmium can be finally removed after that other heavy-metal is removed.","8d6dceec3306417592ac4e01d3bf2359","","eng","naver"

In this study, its properties as an adsorbent were examined and also adsorption of arsenic onto hematite was characterized as well. The specific surface area of hematite synthesized in our laboratory appeared to be $31.8g\;m^2/g$ and its point of zero salt effect, (PZSE) determined by potentiometric titration was observed 8.5. These features of hematite may contribute to high capacity of arsenic adsorption. From several adsorption experiments undertaken at the identical solution concentrations over pH 2~12, the adsorption of As(III) (arsenite) was greater than that of As(V) (arsenate). As of pH-dependent adsorption patterns, in addition, arsenite adsorption gradually increased until pH 9.2 and then sharply decreased with pH, whereas adsorption of arsenate was greatest at pH 2.0 and steadily decreased with the increasing pH from 2 to 12. The characteristics of these pH-dependent adsorption patterns might be caused by combined effects of the variation in the chemical speciation of arsenic and the surface charge of hematite. The experimental results on adsorption kinetics show that adsorption of both arsenic species onto hematite approached equilibrium within 20 h. Additionally, the pseudo-second-order model was evaluated to be the best fit for the adsorption kinetics of arsenic onto hematite, regardless of arsenic species, and the rate constant of As(V) adsorption was investigated to be larger than that of As(III).","ae5718d0698741e9885f632366adad37","","eng","naver"

On LC-MS/ MS, minimum detection level was 12.5 pg and method limit of detection was 5.0 ng/mL. Good linearity ($R^2$ > 0.999) for matrix matched standards was obtained. Recoveries of pesticides from glass fiber filter were 102-109% (kresoxim-methyl) and 97-104% (fenthion) while those from XAD-2 resin were 94-98% (kresoxim methyl) and 93-100% (fenthion). Trapping efficiency test was performed with personal air pumps and IOM sampler (glass fiber filter) connected with solid adsorbent (XAD-2 resin) with two types of formulation (solid and liquid) which were diluted by standard rate and sprayed to IOM sampler. Those pesticides were trapped only in glass fiber filter without any breakthrough to solid adsorbent. After spiking of pesticides to glass fiber filter, breakthrough test was carried out with IOM sampler (glass fiber filter) which was connected with solid adsorbent. As a results, 87-101% of kresoxim-methyl and 96-105% of fenthion remained in spiked glass fiber filter, however, no pesticides were detected in second glass fiber filter and solid adsorbent. In conclusion, IOM sampler which equipped with glass fiber filter can be applied widely for pesticide inhalation exposure study since it has good trapping efficiency and adsorption capacity, regardless of the solid or liquid formulation.","92a73b6867ca4a93a1313dbf859f84de","","eng","naver"

For neutralized particles there was a big difference in areal mass loading rates between charged and uncharged filters due to the very small amount of particle charge, on the other hand the difference was diminished for atomized particle and finally almost vanished for corona charged particles. The pressure drop of filter loaded with corona charged particles was only half of those for neutralized and atomized particles at the same areal mass loading because of the porous structure of particle deposit formed on filter fibers, caused by the space charge effect between particles.","7b3d5ef087e443dca2ae904676688779","","eng","naver"

In the contaminated soils, As was the major contaminant and extracted by sodium hydroxide solution better than by sulfuric acid. However, in the case of the treatment of soil washing effluents, sodium hydroxide was less effective extractant because soil organic matter extracted by sodium hydroxide prevented the solid-liquid phase separation and toxic metal removal. In the treatment of soil washing effluents with sulfuric acid, toxic metals in the effluents were mostly precipitated at the pH above 6.5. In addition, granular ferric oxide (GFO) as an adsorbent enhanced the removal of As and Pb indicating that toxic metals in the washing effluents can be removed almost completely by the use of combined adsorption-neutralization process. This study suggests that soil washing techniques for toxic metals should be optimized based on the physical and chemical properties of the contaminated soils, the nature of chemical extractant, and the removal efficiency and effectiveness of toxic metals from the soils as well as soil washing effluents.","09fe5b200d504d1ba476f434b8d8bbf7","","eng","naver"

Montmorillonite amendment by 5% of soil mass resulted in TNT desorption of 0.12 mg/kg from soil loaded with 9.93 mg/kg-TNT.

Nine commercialized non-ionic surfactants were used for the batch experiment to measure the surfactant solubility for the crude oil because it was reported that they have worked for the soil remediation. Among them, three surfactants having high crude oil solubility were used for the soil washing experiment. From the result of batch experiment, 5% TritonX-100 washing solution showed the highest TPH removal efficiency (67%) for the crude oil contaminated soil. However, because the residual TPH concentration in the washed soil was still higher than the clean-up level in Kuwait (10,000 mg/kg), the repeated soil washing was performed. After five washings with 2% surfactant solution, the cumulative TPH removal efficiency was higher than 96% and the residual TPH concentration in the soil went down below the clean-up level. To measure the desorption capacity of TritonX-100 remained in the soil after the soil washing, the silica beads and the soil were washed five times with 2% TritonX-100 surfactant solution and then they were washed again with distilled water to detach the surfactant adsorbed on beads or soil.

In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","41f2f818294b4a118b11dacf0f281ea9","","eng","naver"

Crude oil degrading microorganisms were isolated from crude oil contaminated soil and temperature, which is a significant factor affecting the remediation efficiency of land farming, was adjusted to evaluate the microbial crude oil degrading ability, degradation time, and remediation efficiency. In order to assess the field applicability, the remediation efficiency was evaluated using crude oil contaminated soil (average TPH concentration of 10,000 mg/kg or more) from the OO premises. Followed by the application of microorganisms at 30℃, the bioremediation process reduced its initial TPH concentration of 10,812 mg/kg down to 1,890 mg/kg in 56 days, which was about an 83% remediation efficiency. By analyzing the correlation among the total number of cells, the number of effective cells, and TPH concentration, it was found that the number of effective microorganisms drastically increased during the period from 10 to 20 days while there was a sharp decrease in TPH concentration. Therefore, we confirmed the applicability of land farming with isolated microorganisms consortium to crude oil contaminated site, which is also expected to be applicable to bioremediation of other recalcitrant materials.","8351c8344b5d43dfaedc69633628019f","","eng","naver"

The soil was sampled at a dried oil pond in Kuwait and its average TPH concentration was 223,754 mg/kg, which was too high to apply the conventional remediation process. Nine commercialized non-ionic surfactants were used for the batch experiment to measure the surfactant solubility for the crude oil because it was reported that they have worked for the soil remediation. Among them, three surfactants having high crude oil solubility were used for the soil washing experiment. From the result of batch experiment, 5% TritonX-100 washing solution showed the highest TPH removal efficiency (67%) for the crude oil contaminated soil. However, because the residual TPH concentration in the washed soil was still higher than the clean-up level in Kuwait (10,000 mg/kg), the repeated soil washing was performed. After five washings with 2% surfactant solution, the cumulative TPH removal efficiency was higher than 96% and the residual TPH concentration in the soil went down below the clean-up level. To measure the desorption capacity of TritonX-100 remained in the soil after the soil washing, the silica beads and the soil were washed five times with 2% TritonX-100 surfactant solution and then they were washed again with distilled water to detach the surfactant adsorbed on beads or soil. After five washings with surfactant solution, 7.8% and 19.6% of the surfactant was adsorbed on beads and soil, respectively. When additionally washed with distilled water, most of the residual surfactant were detached from beads and only 4.3% of surfactant was remained in soil.

In 1992, Bellovin and Merritt proposed an EKE(Encrypted Key Exchange) protocol for user authentication and key exchage that is secure against password guessing attack. After that, many enhanced and secure EKE protocols are proposed so far. In 2006, Lo pointed out that Yeh et al.'s password-based authenticated key exchange protocol has a security weakness and proposed an improved protocol. However, Cao and Lin showed that his protocol is also vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack.

Although the motivation of mobile gift purchasing behavior can be different from that of offline gift purchasing behavior, there is still a lack of research on what factors are influencing and how they are impacting mobile gift purchasing behavior under diverse gift-giving settings. Therefore, based on both exchange and motivation theories as well as literature review, this study identified three influencing factors-economic (immediate rewards, convenience), social (friendship needs, reputation), and personal (enjoyment, self-satisfaction) benefits-and validated their impacts on intention to repurchase a mobile gift. Moreover, the moderating roles of intimacy and gift price in the relationships between benefits and mobile gift repurchasing intention were examined. The results provide many implications for marketing managers on how to enhance consumers' intention to repurchase, which in turn leads to sales and increased profit.","46f628d833174a78b78e192f4b198b66","","eng","naver"

Root-dipping inoculation method has been used to investigate resistance of melon plants to Fusarium wilt. However, the inoculation method requires a lot of labor and time because of complicate procedure. To develop a simple screening method on melon Fusarium wilt, occurrence of Fusarium wilt on susceptible and resistant cultivars of melon according to inoculation method including root-dipping, soil-drenching, tip, and scalpel methods was investigated. Scalpel and tip methods showed more clear resistant and susceptible responses in the melon cultivars than root-dipping inoculation method, but tip method represented slightly variable disease severity. In contrast, in the case of soil-drenching inoculation method, disease severity of the susceptible cultivars was very low. Thus we selected scalpel method as inoculation method of a simple screening method for melon Fusarium wilt. By using the scalpel inoculation method, resistance degrees of the cultivars according to incubation temperature after inoculation (25 and $30^{\circ}C$) and inoculum concentration ($1{\times}10^6$ and $1{\times}10^7conidia/ml$) were measured. The resistance or susceptibility of the cultivars was hardly affected by all the tested conditions. To look into the effectiveness of scalpel inoculation methods, resistance of 22 commercial melon cultivars to FOM was compare with root-dipping inoculation method. When the melon cultivars were inoculated by scalpel method, resistance responses of all the tested cultivars were clearly distinguished as by root-dipping method. Taken together, we suggest that an efficient simple mass-screening method for resistant melon plant to Fusarium wilt is to sow the seeds of melon in a pot (70 ml of soil) and to grow the seedlings in a greenhouse ($25{\pm}5^{\circ}C$) for 7 days, to cut the root of seedlings with a scalpel and then pour a 10 ml-aliquot of the spore suspension of $1{\times}10^6conidia/ml$ on soil. The infected plants were cultivated in a growth room at 25 to $30^{\circ}C$ for about 3 weeks with 12-hr light a day.","a7347a66749b4fa89e2eaf571136a9d0","","eng","naver"

Flame retardant and heat treatments of Lyocell fibers were carried out to obtain carbon fibers with high yield. The prepared carbon fibers were activated by KOH solution for the high specific surface area and controlled pore size to improve $SO_2$ adsorption properties. Copper nitrate was also used to introduce the Cu catalyst on the activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which can induce various reactions in the process; i) copper nitrate promotes the decomposition reaction of oxygen group on the carbon fiber and ii) oxygen radical is generated by the decomposition of copper oxide and nitrates to promote the activation reaction of carbon fibers. As a result, the micro and meso pores were formed and Cu catalysts evenly distributed on ACFs. By Cu-impregnation process, both the specific surface area and micropore volume of carbon fibers increased over 10% compared to those of ACFs only. Also, this resulted in an increase in $SO_2$ adsorption capacity over 149% than that of using the raw ACF. The improvement in $SO_2$ adsorption properties may be originated from the synergy effect of two properties; (i) the physical adsorption from micro, meso and specific surface area due to the transition metal catalyst effect appeared during Cu-impregnation process and ii) the chemical adsorption of $SO_2$ gas promoted by the Cu catalyst on ACFs.","7104020e65124b13b5d172cb2e7eac12","","eng","naver"

In this study, the adsorption characteristics between soil and Cs were investigated according to various physicochemical properties of soil including organic matter contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil particle size, and the types of clay minerals. Soil organic matter inhibited the adsorption of Cs onto the soil because organic matter was blocking the soil surface.

Each pesticide was treated at a concentration of 770.5 mg based on A.I (%). The recovery of pesticide ranged from 77.4 to 99.3%. The volatilized pesticides in air were collected by personal air sampler with PUF tube at 4 l/min flow rate. In addition, temperature and humidity were measured. The collected samples were extracted using acetone in a soxhlet apparatus for 8 hours. The extracted pesticides were resoluted with acetonitrile and diluted 5 times. It was analyzed with LC-MS/MS. For 720 hours experiment, the largest vaporization amount of each pesticide in air was ethoprophos $15.24{\mu}g/m^3$, diazinon $5.14{\mu}g/m^3$, pendimethalin $2.70{\mu}g/m^3$, chlorpyrifos $1.76{\mu}g/m^3$, alachlor $1.40{\mu}g/m^3$, metolachlor $1.12{\mu}g/m^3$, carbaryl $0.27{\mu}g/m^3$, napropamide $0.22{\mu}g/m^3$, tebuconazole $0.11{\mu}g/m^3$ and imidacloprid $0.05{\mu}g/m^3$. The R value (coefficient of correlation) between volatilization and vapor pressure of pesticides is higher than 0.99. Therefore, there is high correlation between volatilization and vapor pressure of pesticides.","f52c5c1346d9496c89cbaf8e5d90dbda","","eng","naver"

The adsorption capacity of Zeolite 3A increased with increasing mass flow rate of hydrogen sulfide($H_2S$) inflow, but the breakthrough time decreased. On the other hand, both the adsorption capacity and breakthrough time of DETOX decreased with increasing mass flow rate of $H_2S$ inflow. The adsorption capacity and breakthrough time of Zeolite 3A decreased with increasing adsorption temperature but those of DETOX increased. The adsorption capacity of DETOX was higher than that of Zeolite 3A by a factor of 2.5 - 16.4 because the collision frequency that overcomes the activation energy barrier increased with increasing adsorption temperature. For Zeolite 3A and DETOX, the adsorption rate of $H_2S$ increased with increasing mass flow rate of $H_2S$ inflow and adsorption temperature. The adsorption rate of $H_2S$ for Zeolite 3A was 4 times as much as that for DETOX. For the removal of $H_2S$ in biogas, DETOX had an advantage over Zeolite 3A because DETOX had a much longer breakthrough time and greater adsorption capacity in the temperature range of 308~318K than Zeolite 3A.","88b32955e5ef464abc10b707a76ecfdf","","eng","naver"

In 2008, fruit clusters were dip treated with $GA_3$ $25.0mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ twice at full bloom (FB) and 14 days after full bloom (DAFB) in a combination with TDZ 0 or $2.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$. Berry seedless rate and berry enlargement were slightly improved only when TDZ was added to the second $GA_3$ treatment at 14 DAFB, compared to $GA_3$ + TDZ treatments at both FB and 14 DAFB. However, berry cracking rate was significantly increased by any plant growth regulator (PGR) treatments compared to non treatment. In 2009, $GA_3$ at $12.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ and $25.0mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ was dip treated twice at FB and 14 DAFB while TDZ $2.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ was treated only at 14 DAFB. Berry cracking rate was depended on the concentration of $GA_3$ applied. The higher concentration at $25.0mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ significantly increased berry cracking rate while the lower concentration at $12.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ had no effect. Also, the addition of TDZ to $GA_3$ $25.0mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ at 14 DAFB, substantially decreased the cracking rate to the level of untreated control. Although all PGR treatments advanced fruit maturity, the most significant advance occurred when TDZ was added to $GA_3$ $12.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ only at the second dip. Considering the overall aspects related to fruit maturity and quality, we concluded that the double applications of $12.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ $GA_3$ at FB and 14 DAFB with addition of $2.5mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ TDZ only at 14 DAFB was appropriate to produce about 400-500 g size of seedless 'Kyoho' grape cluster having 35-40 berries.","3bdb74dc8e7a4e3ebf76ad4ca5509e91","","eng","naver"

Ocean dumping of the coastal dredged materials has become virtually prohibited as London Treaty will be enacted as of the year 2012. It will be necessary to treat and recycle the dredged materials that may carry organic pollutants and heavy metals in a reasonable and effective process: collection of the dredged materials, liquid and solid separation, and treatment of organic compounds and heavy metals. In this study we have developed a continuous bioreactor system that can treat a mixture of silt and particulate organic matter using a microbial consortium (BM-S-1). The steady-state operation conditions were: pH (7.4-7.5), temperature ($16^{\circ}C$), DO (7.5-7.9), and salt concentration (3.4-3.7%). The treatment efficiencies of SCOD, T-N and T-P of the mixture were 95-96%, 92-99%, and 79-97%. The system was also effective in removal of heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, and Cr. Levels of MLSS during three months operation period were 11,000-19,000 mg/L. Interestingly, there was little sludge generated during this period of operation. The augmented microbial consortium seemed to be quite active in the removal of the organic component (30%) present in the dredged material in association with indigenous bacteria. The dominant phyla in the treatment processes were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while dominant genii were Marinobacterium, Flaviramulus, Formosa, Alteromonadaceae_uc, Flavobacteriaceae_uc. These results will contribute to a development of a successful bioremediation technology for various coastal and river sediments with a high content of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and heavy metals, leading to a successful reuse of the polluted dredged sediments.","c3c8bc8ad81f4213b38848be50af6d6f","","eng","naver"

However, carbon and nutrient source is often a limiting factor for microalgal growth leading to higher input costs for sufficient biomass production. Use of municipal wastewater as a low cost alternative to grow microalgae as well as to treat the same has been demonstrated in this study using mini raceway open ponds. Municipal wastewater was collected after primary treatment and microalgae indigenous in the wastewater were encouraged to grow in open raceways under optimum conditions. The mean removal efficiencies of TN, TP, COD-$_{Mn}$, $NH_3$-N after 6 days of retention time was 80.18%, 63.56%, 76.34%, and 96.74% respectively. The 18S rRNA gene analysis of the community revealed the presence of Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus as the dominant microalgae. In addition, 16S rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that Rhodobacter, Luteimonas, Porphyrobacter, Agrobacterium, and Thauera were present along with the microalgae. From these results, it is concluded that microalgae could be used to effectively treat municipal wastewater without aerobic treatment, which incurs additional energy costs. In addition, municipal wastewater shall also serve as an excellent carbon and nitrogen source for microalgal growth. Moreover, the microalgal biomass shall be utilized for commercial purposes.","362051e74314449ba490bbbd7d51c0ee","","eng","naver"

Although closed-pore structure mesoporous ceramic materials have higher mechanical property than open-pore structure, it has a restriction on the application because the increase of specific surface area is limited. So, in this work, specific surface area of closed-pore structure $TiO_2$ was increased by anneal time.

The TBC paste with GGBFS-FA replacement ratios of 20%, 40% and 60% were prepared having a constant water-cementitious materials ratios os 0.5. The research focuses on behavior after 28days(after loading). Four-point bending tests are used to pre-cracked the prismatic specimens at 28days. For specimens (uncracked and cracked) submerged in tap-water and sea-water until 60days. According to the experimental results, the TBC paste system has self-healing ability increased when the fraction of GGBFS increased. Because GGBFS and FA continues to hydrate after 28days, it is likely that hydrated products from GGBFS and FA may modify microstructures, seal these cracks. From these results, it is clear that the crack in all samples experience self-healing and that this occurs mostly in the first 30days of submerging. Futhermore, most of the healing for both specimens of submerged in sea-water and tap-water occurred during the first 30days. Sea-water submerged specimens healed cracks as fast as those in tap-water. Differences in healing effects of submerged in sea-water and tap-water may be attributed to the presence of specific sea-water ions.

Root-dipping inoculation method has been used to investigate resistance of melon plants to Fusarium wilt. However, the inoculation method requires a lot of labor and time because of complicate procedure. To develop a simple screening method on melon Fusarium wilt, occurrence of Fusarium wilt on susceptible and resistant cultivars of melon according to inoculation method including root-dipping, soil-drenching, tip, and scalpel methods was investigated. Scalpel and tip methods showed more clear resistant and susceptible responses in the melon cultivars than root-dipping inoculation method, but tip method represented slightly variable disease severity. In contrast, in the case of soil-drenching inoculation method, disease severity of the susceptible cultivars was very low. Thus we selected scalpel method as inoculation method of a simple screening method for melon Fusarium wilt. By using the scalpel inoculation method, resistance degrees of the cultivars according to incubation temperature after inoculation (25 and $30^{\circ}C$) and inoculum concentration ($1{\times}10^6$ and $1{\times}10^7conidia/ml$) were measured. The resistance or susceptibility of the cultivars was hardly affected by all the tested conditions. To look into the effectiveness of scalpel inoculation methods, resistance of 22 commercial melon cultivars to FOM was compare with root-dipping inoculation method. When the melon cultivars were inoculated by scalpel method, resistance responses of all the tested cultivars were clearly distinguished as by root-dipping method. Taken together, we suggest that an efficient simple mass-screening method for resistant melon plant to Fusarium wilt is to sow the seeds of melon in a pot (70 ml of soil) and to grow the seedlings in a greenhouse ($25{\pm}5^{\circ}C$) for 7 days, to cut the root of seedlings with a scalpel and then pour a 10 ml-aliquot of the spore suspension of $1{\times}10^6conidia/ml$ on soil.

ID-based signature enables authentication and key exchange with a unique ID of a device. However, most of the previous ID-based signature schemes based on RSA require an additional step to share parameters for key exchange so that they are not suitable for resource-constrained devices in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we design an efficient ID-based signature and thereby propose an efficient ID-based authentication and key exchange protocol in which sessions for both an authentication and a key exchange are executed simultaneously. In addition, we prove the security of our scheme under the RSA onewayness problem and analyze the efficiency by comparing with the previous schemes.","1eab008a13324dc48779fcb7751cffe1","","eng","naver"

The manufacturing process was prepared by the manufacturer of the regular smoked egg manufacturing process. A preliminary study found that the preferred salinity of smoked eggs was 1.67~2.00% and the major processing factors have been set to maintain the optimal salinity of smoked eggs and an industrially attainable minimum defect rate below 3%. When the eggs were aged at $50^{\circ}C$ for 96 hours to produce the smoked eggs, the discoloration rate was 0%.

To examine this, the finite-element method with a fluid-structure interaction should be used because the pressure on the pad bottom is changed in real time according to the fluctuations of the force or the moment applied on the pad. This method, however, has high computing costs in terms of modeling efforts and software expense. Moreover, the accuracy of computation is not easily guaranteed. Therefore, a new method combining the experiment and computation is proposed in this paper: the bottom pressure and contact area of the pad under varying loads was measured in real time and the acquired data are then used in the nonlinear elastic finite-element calculations. The computational and experimental results obtained with the product under development showed that the safety margin of the pad under the axial loading is relatively sufficient, whereas with an excessive rotational loading, the pad is vulnerable to separation or a local surface damage; hence, the safety margin may not be secured. The predicted contact behavior under the variation of the magnitude and type of the loading were in good agreement with the one from the experiment. The proposed analysis method in this study could be used in the design of similar vacuum pad systems.","534bd2ceed434cf0834281a716f6bbc9","","eng","naver"

The adsorption characteristics of heavy metals by sesame waste biochar (pyrolysis at $600^{\circ}C$ for 1 hour) as heavy metal absorbent were investigated. The sesame waste biochar was characterized by SEM-EDS and FT-IR, and heavy metal removal was studied using Freundlich and Langmuir equations. The removal rates of heavy metals were higher in the order of Pb>Cu>Cd>Zn, showing that the adsorption efficiency of Pb was higher than those of any other heavy metals. Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to model the equilibrium adsorption data obtained for adsorption of heavy metals on biochar produced from sesame waste. Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn equilibrium adsorption data were fitted well to the two models, but Pb gave a better fit to Langmuir model. Heavy metals were observed on the biochar surface after adsorption by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Main functional groups were aromatic C=O ring (at $1160cm^{-1}$, $1384cm^{-1}$ and $1621cm^{-1}$) by FT-IR analysis. Thus, biochar produced from sesame waste could be useful adsorbent for treating heavy metal wastewaters.","0fe70bb34dfa487cba90a6566e444c0a","","eng","naver"

At first, rape stalk (RS) was immersed in distilled water (DW), acetic acid (AA), oxalic acid (OA), sulfuric acid (SA) and sodium hydroxide (SH) solutions, and the content of reducing sugars liberated from immersed RS was analyzed. Glucose, xylose, arabinose and sucrose were detected varying with the immersion type. In particular, 1% AA-immersion of RS for 72 hr was the most effective conditions to liberate glucose from RS. Secondly, the RS residues were used for elementary analysis and fabrication of fuel pellets. In addition to the solution type, concentration of immersion solutions (0%, 1%, 2%) and immersion time (24, 72, 120 hr) were used as experimental factors. The contents of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine reduced effectively through the immersion of RS in DW, AA and OA solutions. For properties of RS-based pellets, bulk density and higher heating value of RS-based pellets greatly increased with the immersion of RS, and the qualities were much higher than those of the A-grade pellet of the EN standards. Ash content decreased remarkably through the immersion of RS, and was satisfied with the A-grade pellet standard. Durability was negatively affected by the immersion of RS, and did not reached to B-grade of the EN standard. In conclusion, acid immersion of RS can be a pretreatment method for the production of fuel pellet and bioethanol, but use of the immersed RS for the production of high-quality pellets might be restricted due to low durability of immersed-RS pellets. Therefore, further studies, such as investigation of detailed immersion conditions, fabrication of mixed pellets with wooden materials and addition of binders, are needed to resolve the problems.","ecace733ca1b457fa740d271070b6815","","eng","naver"

The purpose of this study was to determine a method to increase the desorption efficiency of 16-PAHs using an ultrasonic extraction procedure. Methods: Test samples prepared spiked XAD-2 tubes and PTFE filters in the range of $0.01-1.0{\mu}g/mL$ for desorption efficiency study. Four different extraction solvents, acetonitrile, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane, were tested in order to select the most suitable solvent for the extraction of the 16 PAHs. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide and sonication time were considered in order to determine the method with the highest extraction efficiency. All samples were made in three sets and analysis was replicated seven times by HPLC. Results: Acetonitrile and acetone were the optimized as an extraction solvent and desorption efficiency of 2-ring PAHs such as naphthalene, acenaphthylene were increased 3~19% with dimethyl sulfoxide for XAD-2. Acetone was the best extraction solvent for PTFE filter and the desorption efficiency was increased 3~13% for 2- to 4-ring PAHs. The optimum sonication time was 60 minutes and desorption efficiency increased with extraction time. Conclusions: As a result, the best extraction solvent was acetone with dimethyl sulfoxide for ultrasonic extraction procedure and the desorption efficiency of this method was better than NIOSH 5506's.

Here, we determined the enamel erosion potential by commercially available carbonated waters with bovine teeth. The erosion was verified by pH value, calcium concentration, and scanning electron microscope. Then plaque accumulation by bacterial adhesion was determined on the enamel erosion surface to measure roughness. In the present study, we observed that the increased calcium content after being immersed in carbonated waters result from the overall enamel erosion. There were no significant differences between general carbonated waters and mineral waters for erosive capacity. Therefore, commercially available carbonated waters are potentially erosive. In addition, oral bacteria strongly adhered to the erosive enamel surfaces thereby facilitating the development of dental plaque. Thus, it is urgently necessary to provide food safety information on the carbonated water as acidic drink to prevent the enamel erosion.","2ef00773968e4caaa8b2825b27fbcc74","","eng","naver"

In addition, it is in the spotlight as a bone-implant material used to assist in the treatment of damaged bones when the bones are cracked or broken. Currently, Ti alloy, stainless steel and Co-Cr-Mo alloy are used as the implant material, and the Mg alloy remains in research stage. The current problem with bone implant implants is that the patients must undergo reoperation to remove the implants after joint surgery. Magnesium, however, can achieve sufficient strength compared to current materials. In addition, since it is self-decomposed after the recovery, reoperation is not necessary. In this paper, Mg alloys were designed by adding harmless Ca and Zn to the human body. In order to improve the strength and corrosion resistance, the final alloy was designed by adding a small amount of Sr as a grain refiner. The radioactive elements of Sr are harmful to the human body, but other naturally occurring Sr elements are harmless. Microstructure analysis of the alloys was performed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties and corrosion characteristics were evaluated by tensile test, potentiodynamic test and immersion test.","f99f5a9d9ed64cff85627d293956be10","","eng","naver"

Removal capacity of Cu using brown seaweed biosorbent in a lab-scale CSTR system was higher than that in a lab-scale PBCC system. On the other hand, over 48 L/day of flow rate in Cu solution, removal efficiency of Cu in a lab-scale PBCC system was higher than that in a lab-scale CSTR system. Optimum flow rate of Cu was 24 L/day, optimum Cu solution concentration was 100 mg/L. Removal capacity of Cu at different stages was higher in the order of double column biosorption system > single column biosorption system. Under different heavy metals, removal capacities of heavy metal were higher in the order of Pb > Cr > Ni > Mn ${\geq}$ Cu ${\geq}$ Cd ${\fallingdotseq}$ Zn ${\geq}$ Co. Removal capacity of Cu was 138 L in a large-scale PBCC system. Removal capacity of Cu a large-scale PBCC system was similar with in a lab-scale PBCC system. CONCLUSION(s): Therefore, PBCC system using brown seaweed biosorbent was suitable for treating heavy metal wastewater.","3ffb524780e74daea4599de3ad7ab55f","","eng","naver"

The results of the study are summarized as follows: Except for samples eluted powder of recycled aggregate 1%, all the samples were high alkali suspensions with higher than pH 12.0. In particular, when eluted time was 5 hours, the sample eluted powder of recycled aggregate 3% showed about 15 mg/l of calcium hydroxide that was not different from the amount of calcium hydroxide in the mixing water eluted powder of recycled aggregate 5%. Hence, from this results, it can be considered that optimal eluted powder of recycled aggregate was 3% in this study. When using mixing water eluted with powder of recycled aggregate, compared to use of ordinary mixing water, it showed greater compressive strength in the entire ages, and in the sample replaced with ground granulated blast furnace slag by 50%, its compressive strength was greater than that of the OPC. As use of mixing water eluted with powder of recycled aggregate in concrete used with large amount of ground granulated blast furnace slag was more effective for improving compressive strength than ordinary mixing water, it is verified that powder of recycled aggregate had an effect of activator.","655357406b1f44018beb57680264cf26","","eng","naver"

In this study, its properties as an adsorbent were examined and also adsorption of arsenic onto hematite was characterized as well. The specific surface area of hematite synthesized in our laboratory appeared to be $31.8g\;m^2/g$ and its point of zero salt effect, (PZSE) determined by potentiometric titration was observed 8.5. These features of hematite may contribute to high capacity of arsenic adsorption. From several adsorption experiments undertaken at the identical solution concentrations over pH 2~12, the adsorption of As(III) (arsenite) was greater than that of As(V) (arsenate). As of pH-dependent adsorption patterns, in addition, arsenite adsorption gradually increased until pH 9.2 and then sharply decreased with pH, whereas adsorption of arsenate was greatest at pH 2.0 and steadily decreased with the increasing pH from 2 to 12. The characteristics of these pH-dependent adsorption patterns might be caused by combined effects of the variation in the chemical speciation of arsenic and the surface charge of hematite. The experimental results on adsorption kinetics show that adsorption of both arsenic species onto hematite approached equilibrium within 20 h. Additionally, the pseudo-second-order model was evaluated to be the best fit for the adsorption kinetics of arsenic onto hematite, regardless of arsenic species, and the rate constant of As(V) adsorption was investigated to be larger than that of As(III).","baa374504ad2426cb58ca909b3c9536c","","eng","naver"

Root-dipping inoculation method has been used to investigate resistance of melon plants to Fusarium wilt. However, the inoculation method requires a lot of labor and time because of complicate procedure. To develop a simple screening method on melon Fusarium wilt, occurrence of Fusarium wilt on susceptible and resistant cultivars of melon according to inoculation method including root-dipping, soil-drenching, tip, and scalpel methods was investigated. Scalpel and tip methods showed more clear resistant and susceptible responses in the melon cultivars than root-dipping inoculation method, but tip method represented slightly variable disease severity. In contrast, in the case of soil-drenching inoculation method, disease severity of the susceptible cultivars was very low. Thus we selected scalpel method as inoculation method of a simple screening method for melon Fusarium wilt. By using the scalpel inoculation method, resistance degrees of the cultivars according to incubation temperature after inoculation (25 and $30^{\circ}C$) and inoculum concentration ($1{\times}10^6$ and $1{\times}10^7conidia/ml$) were measured. The resistance or susceptibility of the cultivars was hardly affected by all the tested conditions. To look into the effectiveness of scalpel inoculation methods, resistance of 22 commercial melon cultivars to FOM was compare with root-dipping inoculation method. When the melon cultivars were inoculated by scalpel method, resistance responses of all the tested cultivars were clearly distinguished as by root-dipping method. Taken together, we suggest that an efficient simple mass-screening method for resistant melon plant to Fusarium wilt is to sow the seeds of melon in a pot (70 ml of soil) and to grow the seedlings in a greenhouse ($25{\pm}5^{\circ}C$) for 7 days, to cut the root of seedlings with a scalpel and then pour a 10 ml-aliquot of the spore suspension of $1{\times}10^6conidia/ml$ on soil.

Methods: The number of adherent S. aureus on clear and circle soft contact lenses made of etafilcon A, hilafilcon B, nelfilcon A was measured before and after incubation in artificial tear. Furthermore, the denaturalization level of tear protein with time after incubation in artificial tear was estimated by electrophoresis. Results: The adherence of S. aureus was significantly different according to the lens materials. The pattern of bacterial adherence on clear and circle contact lenses was different. That is, the adherent amount of S. aureus was somewhat larger on circle lens made of etafilcon A however, amount on circle lenses made of hilafilcon B and nelfilcon A was 89.3% and 71.3% of the number on clear lenses. When the tear protein was deposited on contact lenses, the number of adherent bacteria decreased and its degree was varied according to the lens material.

The reduction of membrane fouling was evaluated according to the number of electrodes (immersed surface area of electrodes), current density and contact time. In the case of the small surface area of electrodes, the increased electric field strength resulted in a soluble COD increase due to the destruction of the microbial flocs and/or cells, whereas large changes in the soluble COD were not observed in the case of the high surface area of electrodes. On the other hand, the T-P concentration decreased as a result of the precipitation of aluminum ions and phosphates. The membrane permeation flux increased and the fouling resistance (Rc+Rf) decreased with increasing electric current density. Although the particle size of the anaerobic digestion effluent increased slightly, it was not related directly to the reduced fouling phenomena. The main mechanism for the enhanced flux was attributed to the inorganic particulate produced during electrocoagulation, such as $AlPO_4$, which acted as a dynamic membrane deposited on the membrane surface.","113e44374f264bcfa7d7eb3606788e7f","","eng","naver"

The longest vase life of cut roses was observed in the holding solution with FAC $20mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ as 12 days, followed by pulsing with $400mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$ as 11 days, which were four or five days longer than the control. In addition, relative fresh weight and water uptake were the highest in the holding solutions with FAC 20 and $40mg{\cdot}L^{-1}$. The antimicrobial effect of FAC in vase solution was lasted for eight days after treatment, which was offset by sucrose addition. FAC contents in the FAC holding solution mixed with sucrose were exhausted by 88% two days after treatment, whereas only 15% of FAC was reduced in the holding solution without sucrose. This study indicated that FAC can be applied to extension of the postharvest life of cut roses by antimicrobial activity.","715885a9530f4ad3ac56bf53c99fafc8","","eng","naver"

In Korea, more than 120 tons of sulfur are produced by refinery, and about 50 % of the produced sulfur is used as a raw material for the production of fertilizer and sulfuric acid. Modified sulfur is manufactured from excessive sulfur that could be used to improve concrete properties, and this study evaluated concrete strength and durability that contains modified sulfur. Flexural and compressive strengths of concrete with sulfur modified polymer were comparable to those of OPC concrete with mixing water at similar temperatures, while the strengths increased a little as mixing water temperature increased. It was also confirmed that the resistance to freeze-thaw damage was more dependent on entrained air characteristics obtained by a proper use of air entraining agent than on the use of sulfur modified polymer. When concrete was immersed in 5 % sulfuric acid, the rate of reduction in compressive strength of OPC concrete was less than 1/4 of the strength reduction of concrete with sulfur modified polymer. Also, the resistance of concrete with sulfur modified polymer to scaling due to the use of de-icing salt was evaluated as Class 1, while that of OPC concrete was evaluated as Class 4, as aggregates were exposed. Accordingly, it is believed that sulfur modified polymer could be effectively used for bridge deck concrete since sulfur modified polymer improves the durability of concrete.","79124cf7424a49db84bbb44b817596f8","","eng","naver"

Methods: The adherent number of C. albicans on clear soft contact lenses (hereinafter clear lenses) and circle soft contact lenses (hereinafter circle lenses) made of etafilcon A, hilaiflcon B and nelfilcon A, respectively, was measured before and after the deposition of artificial tear. Also, bacteria adherence on lenses were observed by a scanning electron microscope. Results: Adherence of C. albicans was significantly different according to lens materials. The amount of adsorption was not different between clear lenses and circle lenses made of etafilcon A however, the number of bacteria absorption was bigger in hilafilcon B and nelfilcon A lenses. More absorption of C. albicans was found in the non-pigmented central area compared the pigmented area, and non-pigmented peripheral area has more bacterial absorption than non-pigmented central area. The number of C. albicans decreased in the case that tear protein was pre-deposited. The maintenance of antibacterial activity against C. albicans was different according to lens materials thus, etafilcon A has the longest period of its maintenance. Conclusions: It was revealed that the number of C. albicans was different according to the characteristics of lens materials, pigmentation or non-pigmentation, the pigmented area of soft contact lenses. Thus, it is suggested that the management method should be different according to the adsorption characteristics of C. albicans.","1582fdf411ab4233b04d7ca49845072e","","eng","naver"

Mature seeds that developed under these conditions were analyzed for variances in physicochemical properties. The 100-seed weight and seed-coat ratio of soybean were decreased, but small seed rate was increased by high temperature during seed filling period. Protein content was increased, but oil content was decreased significantly with increasing the seed filling temperature. The decrement of carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), and the increment of monosaccharide, fructose and sucrose, in seeds explained that carbohydrate assimilation during seed filling was restricted by high temperature. Rapid increments of seed volume and weight were observed in the seeds of high seed filling temperature, but as soaking time increased the highest values were observed in the seeds of ambient seed filling temperature. The 100-seed weight and seed-coat ratio of soybean were closely related not only to the increment of soaking volume and weight, but also the increments of total dissolved solids (TDS) and electro conductivity (EC). Whereas protein content and C/N ratio showed less relationship with the soaking properties, but they had a positive correlation with TDS and EC. From the results, it was considered that high values of TDS and EC in the seeds of high temperature were mainly due to the incomplete conversion of assimilates into storage compounds.

In order to convert corn stover to ethanol, various pretreatments followed by simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) were tested and evaluated in terms of ethanol yield. With 3%, w/w of glucan loading using ARP-, DSA-, and SAA-treated solids, SSCFs using recombinant E. coli strain (ATCC$^{(R)}$ 55124) with commercial enzymes (15 FPU of Spezyme CP/g-glucan and 30 CBU/g-glucan enzyme loading) were tested. In the SSCF tests, 87, 90, and 78% of theoretical maximum ethanol yield were observed using ARP-, DSA-, and SAA-treated solids, respectively, which were 69, 58, and 74% on the basis of total carbohydrates (glucan + xylan) in the untreated corn stover. Ethanol yield of SAA-treated solid was higher than those of ARP- and DSA-treated solids. In addition, SSCF test using treated solids plus pretreated hydrolysate indicated that the DSA-treated hydrolysate showed the strongest inhibition effect on the KO11 strain, whereas the ARP-treated hydrolysate was found to have the second strongest inhibition effect. Bioconversion scheme using SAA pretreatment and SSCF can make the downstream process simple, which is suggested to produce ethanol economically because utilization of hemicellulose in the hydrolysate is not necessary.","d4fbc1a39fb2490585b11404f31d5b11","","eng","naver"

The reduction of membrane fouling was evaluated according to the number of electrodes (immersed surface area of electrodes), current density and contact time. In the case of the small surface area of electrodes, the increased electric field strength resulted in a soluble COD increase due to the destruction of the microbial flocs and/or cells, whereas large changes in the soluble COD were not observed in the case of the high surface area of electrodes. On the other hand, the T-P concentration decreased as a result of the precipitation of aluminum ions and phosphates. The membrane permeation flux increased and the fouling resistance (Rc+Rf) decreased with increasing electric current density. Although the particle size of the anaerobic digestion effluent increased slightly, it was not related directly to the reduced fouling phenomena. The main mechanism for the enhanced flux was attributed to the inorganic particulate produced during electrocoagulation, such as $AlPO_4$, which acted as a dynamic membrane deposited on the membrane surface.","0efb030054c84c52bddf84992975fc0b","","eng","naver"

For the concrete mixtures, 24MPa, 27MPa and 40MPa of nominal strength were adopted with 30% and 70%(only for 24MPa) of 5~13mm recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement and without 5~13mm RCA(Plain). For test items, slump, slump flow, compressive strength with different curing conditions, core drilling, rebound numbers and drying shrinkage were measured. Test results indicated that 30% of 5~13 mm RCA replacement resulted in increase in slump, slump flow and resistance against segregation, while air contents decreased compared to those of plain mixture. Compressive strength of concrete with 30% of 5~13mm RCA was shown to be higher than that of plain mixture due to optimum packing effect associated with presence of well graded aggregates. Rebound number of the mock-up specimen with 30% of 5~13mm RCA had lower fluctuation according to hitting location than that of plain mock-up specimen.

To examine this, the finite-element method with a fluid-structure interaction should be used because the pressure on the pad bottom is changed in real time according to the fluctuations of the force or the moment applied on the pad. This method, however, has high computing costs in terms of modeling efforts and software expense. Moreover, the accuracy of computation is not easily guaranteed. Therefore, a new method combining the experiment and computation is proposed in this paper: the bottom pressure and contact area of the pad under varying loads was measured in real time and the acquired data are then used in the nonlinear elastic finite-element calculations. The computational and experimental results obtained with the product under development showed that the safety margin of the pad under the axial loading is relatively sufficient, whereas with an excessive rotational loading, the pad is vulnerable to separation or a local surface damage; hence, the safety margin may not be secured. The predicted contact behavior under the variation of the magnitude and type of the loading were in good agreement with the one from the experiment. The proposed analysis method in this study could be used in the design of similar vacuum pad systems.","c10de982791f4d4f882e943464133eaa","","eng","naver"

The reduction of membrane fouling was evaluated according to the number of electrodes (immersed surface area of electrodes), current density and contact time. In the case of the small surface area of electrodes, the increased electric field strength resulted in a soluble COD increase due to the destruction of the microbial flocs and/or cells, whereas large changes in the soluble COD were not observed in the case of the high surface area of electrodes.

As a result, the adsorption performance was improved by 2 to 20 times or more compared to that of using the metal foam support. This is maybe due to the enhancement of pore distribution which was confirmed by SEM. In addition, the adsorption performance was 13.95 mg/g by adding lignin, and also an average adsorption performance of 13.25 mg/g was maintained after washing indicating that a highly durable adsorption filter material was prepared.

Here, we determined the enamel erosion potential by commercially available carbonated waters with bovine teeth. The erosion was verified by pH value, calcium concentration, and scanning electron microscope. Then plaque accumulation by bacterial adhesion was determined on the enamel erosion surface to measure roughness. In the present study, we observed that the increased calcium content after being immersed in carbonated waters result from the overall enamel erosion. There were no significant differences between general carbonated waters and mineral waters for erosive capacity. Therefore, commercially available carbonated waters are potentially erosive. In addition, oral bacteria strongly adhered to the erosive enamel surfaces thereby facilitating the development of dental plaque. Thus, it is urgently necessary to provide food safety information on the carbonated water as acidic drink to prevent the enamel erosion.","bc9894632901477a8791ca516c237042","","eng","naver"

The prepared carbon fibers were activated by KOH solution for the high specific surface area and controlled pore size to improve $SO_2$ adsorption properties. Copper nitrate was also used to introduce the Cu catalyst on the activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which can induce various reactions in the process; i) copper nitrate promotes the decomposition reaction of oxygen group on the carbon fiber and ii) oxygen radical is generated by the decomposition of copper oxide and nitrates to promote the activation reaction of carbon fibers. As a result, the micro and meso pores were formed and Cu catalysts evenly distributed on ACFs.

Also, this resulted in an increase in $SO_2$ adsorption capacity over 149% than that of using the raw ACF.

The recoveries of pesticides were in the range of 70-120% with < 20% RSD except 4 pesticides, Benfuracarb, Ethiofencarb, Pymetrozine, and Pyrethrin. This result indicated that the method using QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS could be applied for the simultaneous determination of pesticide residues in soils.","5a80e111b42e452f929e79a5c5d60dda","","eng","naver"

The adsorption characteristics of heavy metals by sesame waste biochar (pyrolysis at $600^{\circ}C$ for 1 hour) as heavy metal absorbent were investigated. The sesame waste biochar was characterized by SEM-EDS and FT-IR, and heavy metal removal was studied using Freundlich and Langmuir equations. The removal rates of heavy metals were higher in the order of Pb>Cu>Cd>Zn, showing that the adsorption efficiency of Pb was higher than those of any other heavy metals. Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to model the equilibrium adsorption data obtained for adsorption of heavy metals on biochar produced from sesame waste. Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn equilibrium adsorption data were fitted well to the two models, but Pb gave a better fit to Langmuir model. Heavy metals were observed on the biochar surface after adsorption by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Main functional groups were aromatic C=O ring (at $1160cm^{-1}$, $1384cm^{-1}$ and $1621cm^{-1}$) by FT-IR analysis.

The decrement of carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), and the increment of monosaccharide, fructose and sucrose, in seeds explained that carbohydrate assimilation during seed filling was restricted by high temperature. Rapid increments of seed volume and weight were observed in the seeds of high seed filling temperature, but as soaking time increased the highest values were observed in the seeds of ambient seed filling temperature. The 100-seed weight and seed-coat ratio of soybean were closely related not only to the increment of soaking volume and weight, but also the increments of total dissolved solids (TDS) and electro conductivity (EC). Whereas protein content and C/N ratio showed less relationship with the soaking properties, but they had a positive correlation with TDS and EC. From the results, it was considered that high values of TDS and EC in the seeds of high temperature were mainly due to the incomplete conversion of assimilates into storage compounds. However, sugar content showed less influence on the soaking properties and the values of TDS and EC.","b114a63fa8554d28a81225a51c304467","","eng","naver"

Experimental results indicated that the maximum deterioration was noted in OPC mortar specimens subjected to Exposure B, showing the wide cracks in the portions where attacking solution is adjacent to air. Additionally, the beneficial effect of ground granulated blast-furnace slag and silica fume was clearly observed showing a superior resistance against sodium sulfate attack, because of its lower permeability and densified structure.

Recently, geosmin and 2-MIB are detected frequently at abnormally high concentration level. However, conventional water treatment without advanced water treatment processes such as adsorption and oxidation process, cannot remove these two compounds efficiently. Moreover, it is known that the advanced treatment processes i.e. adsorption and oxidation have also several limits to the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB. Therefore, the purpose of this study was not only to evaluate full scale nanofiltration membrane system with $300m^3/day$ of permeate capacity and 90% of recovery on the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB in spiked natural raw water sources at high feed concentration with a range of approximately 500 to 2,500 ng/L, but also to observe rejection property of the compounds within multi stage NF membrane system.

But, according to results of regression analysis in this study it is recommended that feed water concentration of geosmin and 2-MIB would not exceed 220 and 300 ng/L respectively which is not to be perceived in drinking tap water. Also it suggests that the removal rate might be depended on an operating conditions such as feed water characteristics and membrane flux. When each stage of NF membrane system was evaluated relatively higher removal rate was observed at the conditions that is lower flux, higher DOC and TDS, i.e., $2^{nd}$ stage NF membrane systems, possibly due to an interaction mechanisms between compounds and cake layer on the membrane surfaces.","5eb42289b45e4b37828626a46fd37479","","eng","naver"

In order to convert corn stover to ethanol, various pretreatments followed by simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) were tested and evaluated in terms of ethanol yield. With 3%, w/w of glucan loading using ARP-, DSA-, and SAA-treated solids, SSCFs using recombinant E. coli strain (ATCC$^{(R)}$ 55124) with commercial enzymes (15 FPU of Spezyme CP/g-glucan and 30 CBU/g-glucan enzyme loading) were tested. In the SSCF tests, 87, 90, and 78% of theoretical maximum ethanol yield were observed using ARP-, DSA-, and SAA-treated solids, respectively, which were 69, 58, and 74% on the basis of total carbohydrates (glucan + xylan) in the untreated corn stover. Ethanol yield of SAA-treated solid was higher than those of ARP- and DSA-treated solids. In addition, SSCF test using treated solids plus pretreated hydrolysate indicated that the DSA-treated hydrolysate showed the strongest inhibition effect on the KO11 strain, whereas the ARP-treated hydrolysate was found to have the second strongest inhibition effect. Bioconversion scheme using SAA pretreatment and SSCF can make the downstream process simple, which is suggested to produce ethanol economically because utilization of hemicellulose in the hydrolysate is not necessary.","c438fd2998854b2cadf8ec477fca0f95","","eng","naver"

In addition, the arsenic adsorption performance showed a high dependency on the specific surface area of hollow fibers. It was confirmed that the abundancy of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites provided was favorable for the arsenic adsorption. It was also demonstrated that commercially available $TiO_2$ powders can be an attractive candidate material for manufacturing hollow fibers for a small scale water treatment plant.","c0c473cb6b7e4743a7b1a8845905db6f","","eng","naver"

An adversary can compromise a sensor node and launch a variety of attacks such as false report injection attacks. This attack may cause monetary damage resulting in energy drain by forwarding the false reports and false alarms at the base station. In order to address this problem, a number of en-route filtering schemes has been proposed. Notably, a dynamic en-route filtering scheme can save energy by filtering of the false report. In the key dissemination phase of the existing scheme, the nodes closer to the source node may not have matching keys to detect the false report. Therefore, continuous attacks may result in unnecessary energy wastage. In this paper, we propose a key re-distribution scheme to solve this issue. The proposed scheme early detects the false report injection attacks using initially assigned secret keys in the phase of the key pre-distribution. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our scheme with energy efficiency of up to 26.63% and filtering capacity up to 15.92% as compared to the existing scheme.","d46b2fa9559146139d241dd521732244","","eng","naver"

Due to the limited space for the waste shell disposal, the related environmental problem has been a serious issue. It is believed that using the waste shells as a source of aggregate for mortar, concrete or bricks can be a good solution. In this research, possibility of utilizing waste shells as an aggregate of mortar is investigated. Waste shells of manila clam, cockle, clam, sea mussel, and oyster were properly crushed, sieved, and sorted to meet the requirements of the grading of standard fine aggregate. After that, the waste shells were used as partial and total replacement of the fine aggregate, and their absorption and 28-day compressive strengths of mortar were measured. In general, replacement of waste shells increased the absorption and decreased the strength. However, one specimen with cockle increased compressive strength as replacement ratio increased. Mortar with cockle of 50% and 100% replacement showed higher compressive strength than that of control mortar. This increase of compressive strength was found to be affected by the strong interfacial bonding properties of the cockle and a cement matrix.","e4e5a0a8d0ea4042acb7d79a0924cb4e","","eng","naver"

A great synthetic effort has been focused on developing efficient and practical procedures to prepare rhodamine derivatives, because for most applications the probe must be covalently linked to another (bio)molecule or surface. Sulforhodamine B is one of the most used rhodamine dyes for this purpose, because it carries two sulfoxy functions which can be easily utilized for binding with other molecules. Recently, we needed an expedient, practical synthesis of sulforhodamine derivatives. We found the existing procedure for obtaining those compounds unsatisfactory, particularly, with the cyclization process of the dihydroxytriarylmethane (1) to produce the corresponding xanthene derivative (2). We report here our findings, which represent modification of the existing literature procedure and provide access to the corresponding xanthene derivative (2) in a high yield. Use of methanol as a co-solvent was found quite effective to prohibit the water molecule produced during the cyclization reaction from retro-cyclizing back to the starting dihydroxytriarylmethane and the yield of the cyclization was increased (up to 84% from less than 20%). The reaction temperature was significantly lowered (80 vs. 135 ℃). Thus, the reaction proceeds in a higher yield and energy-saving manner where the use of reactants and the production of chemical wastes is minimized.","eaa8744ca68449e19a64b419a6248d57","","eng","naver"

Flame retardant and heat treatments of Lyocell fibers were carried out to obtain carbon fibers with high yield. The prepared carbon fibers were activated by KOH solution for the high specific surface area and controlled pore size to improve $SO_2$ adsorption properties. Copper nitrate was also used to introduce the Cu catalyst on the activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which can induce various reactions in the process; i) copper nitrate promotes the decomposition reaction of oxygen group on the carbon fiber and ii) oxygen radical is generated by the decomposition of copper oxide and nitrates to promote the activation reaction of carbon fibers. As a result, the micro and meso pores were formed and Cu catalysts evenly distributed on ACFs. By Cu-impregnation process, both the specific surface area and micropore volume of carbon fibers increased over 10% compared to those of ACFs only. Also, this resulted in an increase in $SO_2$ adsorption capacity over 149% than that of using the raw ACF. The improvement in $SO_2$ adsorption properties may be originated from the synergy effect of two properties; (i) the physical adsorption from micro, meso and specific surface area due to the transition metal catalyst effect appeared during Cu-impregnation process and ii) the chemical adsorption of $SO_2$ gas promoted by the Cu catalyst on ACFs.","b13aba31fec1434895b0ef7a28834c5f","","eng","naver"

In addition, the frequency of yellow dust incidences in Korea has increased by more than four times compared to levels from the 1970s. Statistical reports indicate that annual damages caused by yellow dust amount to more than six trillion KRW. This study developed a zero-fog multi-layer mask with a collection efficiency and yellow dust and particulate matter filtration areas that are at least thrice as effective as existing masks. The new mask also reduces pressure drag by half.","277caa2a7dc84bf9af70a0254a6d541b","","eng","naver"

A great synthetic effort has been focused on developing efficient and practical procedures to prepare rhodamine derivatives, because for most applications the probe must be covalently linked to another (bio)molecule or surface. Sulforhodamine B is one of the most used rhodamine dyes for this purpose, because it carries two sulfoxy functions which can be easily utilized for binding with other molecules. Recently, we needed an expedient, practical synthesis of sulforhodamine derivatives. We found the existing procedure for obtaining those compounds unsatisfactory, particularly, with the cyclization process of the dihydroxytriarylmethane (1) to produce the corresponding xanthene derivative (2). We report here our findings, which represent modification of the existing literature procedure and provide access to the corresponding xanthene derivative (2) in a high yield. Use of methanol as a co-solvent was found quite effective to prohibit the water molecule produced during the cyclization reaction from retro-cyclizing back to the starting dihydroxytriarylmethane and the yield of the cyclization was increased (up to 84% from less than 20%). The reaction temperature was significantly lowered (80 vs. 135 ℃). Thus, the reaction proceeds in a higher yield and energy-saving manner where the use of reactants and the production of chemical wastes is minimized.","65bb08a1ead84233a357b4765831820f","","eng","naver"

Results reported here indicate that DOM fouling layer with a humic acid does not necessarily lead to an immediate loss of permeate flux but can result in a severe impact on the flux loss when both humic acid and inorganic scaltants were presented simultaneously. The $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$ mixed with humic acid showd most sever flux loss (42%) compared to that of only humic acid presence (8%). It could be a result that the scaling formation of the NF membrane was dominated by cake layer formation of DOM and it was along with pore blocking by the formation of crystals inside the porous active matrix of the NF membrane. In addition, these results indicated that the membrane selectivity of the explosives retention trended correlated with respect to increasing explosives size (listed by MW) based on greater steric interactions and followed the order (MW, g $mol^{-1}$; removal, %): HMX (296.15; 83%) ${\gg}$ RDX (222.12; 49%) ≋ TNT (227.13; 32%).

There are many disposal methods to remove odor, but there are many disadvantages and inadequate applications. The Purpose of this study was to develop a bag-filer system for odor removal using powder adsorbent. Methods: The bag-filter system is composed of a shear bag filter, an absorbent spraying system and an absorbent circulation system. The spraying absorbent system was connected with the inlet duct of the shear bag filter for inputting adsorbent. And the absorbent circulation system can transport the collecting adsorbent from hoper to the inlet duct of the system. As a result, the adsorbent can remove odor with recycling in the system. Also affective factors like the powdered absorbent combination and injection method was researched for maximization of system efficiency. The study was conducted in two stages. The first step was testing equipment made and the second is to evaluate the efficiency of the odor control by connecting to the actual odor generation process. Results: Both experiment stages showed efficient odor control ability. The adsorption efficiency of the system is demonstrated and the odor was adsorbed well by the powder adsorbent. It is essential to accurately understand the characteristics of the odorous and use the appropriate adsorbent. Although the powder adsorbent was used in the experiment, the problem of scattering did not occur due to the high degree of system sealing. Also the system manufactured in this study was designed to recycle the adsorbent, so adsorbent reuse or batch processing is convenient. Conclusions: The applicability of the system has been proven through this research. Customized systems for industrial process and the appropriate adsorbent base on the characteristics of pollutant generation will show efficient odor collection ability.","78a93eda1ed4448a94cc67e1e7be47bb","","eng","naver"

The attacker can generate various attacks using compromised nodes in a sensor network. The false report generating application layers injects the network by the compromised node. If a base station has the injected false report, a false alarm also occurs and unnecessary energy of the node is used. In order to defend the attack, a statistical en-route filtering method is proposed to filter the false report that goes to the base station as soon as possible. A path renewal method, which improves the method, is proposed to maintain a detection ability of the statistical en-route filtering method and to consume balanced energy of the node. In this paper, we proposed the secure path cycle method to consume effective energy for a path renewal. To select the secure path cycle, the base station determines through hop counts and the quantity of report transmission by an evaluation function. In addition, three methods, which are statistical en-route filter, path selection method, and path renewal method, are evaluated with our proposed method for efficient energy use. Therefore, the proposed method keeps the secure path and makes the efficiency of energy consumption high.","9c52c976bd92493c9c5961d6684d2b59","","eng","naver"

To solve this problem, electro-coagulation technique has been applied to MBR. A series of electro-coagulation was applied to activated sludge suspension under different current density condition. After the electro-coagulations, membrane filtration of the activated sludge suspensions was conducted to investigate the effect of electro-coagulation on the fouling. As current density increased 10 to 40A/m2, the total fouling resistance (Rc+Rf) decreased from 18 to 79%, showing that the electro-coagulation improved the membrane filtration efficiency. Both the organic concentration in bulk and the particles size distribution were not nearly changed before and after the electro-coagulation. The enhanced filtration efficiency might be due to the aluminum hydroxide generated from chemical precipitation, which can be acted as a dynamic membrane preventing a deposition of foulants on membrane surfaces.","549749266d0d4b9eb113fe65faa04a44","","eng","naver"

An adversary can compromise a sensor node and launch a variety of attacks such as false report injection attacks. This attack may cause monetary damage resulting in energy drain by forwarding the false reports and false alarms at the base station. In order to address this problem, a number of en-route filtering schemes has been proposed. Notably, a dynamic en-route filtering scheme can save energy by filtering of the false report. In the key dissemination phase of the existing scheme, the nodes closer to the source node may not have matching keys to detect the false report. Therefore, continuous attacks may result in unnecessary energy wastage. In this paper, we propose a key re-distribution scheme to solve this issue. The proposed scheme early detects the false report injection attacks using initially assigned secret keys in the phase of the key pre-distribution. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our scheme with energy efficiency of up to 26.63% and filtering capacity up to 15.92% as compared to the existing scheme.","548d9eb1e8db4b288fda0b55b7b4bbd6","","eng","naver"

Iron (Fe) associated with sediment in contact with groundwater and infiltrating surface water is an important factor in determining the quality of water recovered from the pumping wells in river bank filtration. This study reports the results of Fe speciation in the aquifer sediment samples collected from different depths at the river bank filtration site in Changwon, studied using four different chemical extraction methods, namely, ferrozine, oxalate, HCl, and DCB methods. Overall, the results show that Fe(II) as well as the total Fe content decreases with depth down to ~20 m and then increases further below. This trend is consistent with the redox characteristics suggested by visual observation.

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","9d5ad4520d37481a82fc72aba6b93950","","eng","naver"

Iron (Fe) associated with sediment in contact with groundwater and infiltrating surface water is an important factor in determining the quality of water recovered from the pumping wells in river bank filtration. This study reports the results of Fe speciation in the aquifer sediment samples collected from different depths at the river bank filtration site in Changwon, studied using four different chemical extraction methods, namely, ferrozine, oxalate, HCl, and DCB methods. Overall, the results show that Fe(II) as well as the total Fe content decreases with depth down to ~20 m and then increases further below. This trend is consistent with the redox characteristics suggested by visual observation. The silt/clay size fraction (${\phi}$ < 62.5 ${\mu}M$) has up to 2~10 times more Fe compared with the sand size fraction (62.5 ${\mu}M$ < ${\phi}$ < 2 mm), depending on the extraction method. Of the four extraction methods, DCB solution extracted the most Fe from the sediment samples. The amounts of Fe extracted by the different extraction methods can be a good indicator of the redox conditions along the depth of the aquifer.","9ef7266124d948679af20a6408406d04","","eng","naver"

Despite the continuous development of filtration technology, targeting densely populated urban areas, CSOs are rarely applied. Therefore, this study was carried out to optimize the process to apply CSOs in a pilot-scale horizontal flow filtration system with a rope-type synthetic fiber. The research was carried out in two steps: a preliminary study using artificial samples and a field study using sewage. In the preliminary study using an artificial sample, head loss of the filter media itself was analyzed to be approximately 1.1cm, and the head loss was increased by approximately 0.1cm as the linear velocity was increased by 10m/hr. In addition, the SS removal efficiency was stable at 81.4%, the filtration duration was maintained for more than 6 hours, and the average recovery rate of 98% was obtained by air backwashing only. In the on-site evaluation using sewage, the filtration duration was approximately 2 hours and the average removal efficiency of 83.9% was obtained when belt screen (over 450 mesh) was applied as a pre-treatment process to prevent the premature clogging of filter media. To apply the filtration process to CSOs and SSOs, it was concluded that the combination with the pre-treatment process was important to reinforce the hydraulic dimension for the stable maintain of operation period, rather than efficiency. Compared to the dry season, the quality of incoming sewage was lower in the rainy season, which was attributed to the characteristics of the drainage area with higher sanitary sewerage. In addition, the difference in removal efficiency according to the influent quality of the wet season and dry season was small.","edc3c06c37b54702978e7db1a07e5531","","eng","naver"

In the contaminated soils, As was the major contaminant and extracted by sodium hydroxide solution better than by sulfuric acid. However, in the case of the treatment of soil washing effluents, sodium hydroxide was less effective extractant because soil organic matter extracted by sodium hydroxide prevented the solid-liquid phase separation and toxic metal removal. In the treatment of soil washing effluents with sulfuric acid, toxic metals in the effluents were mostly precipitated at the pH above 6.5. In addition, granular ferric oxide (GFO) as an adsorbent enhanced the removal of As and Pb indicating that toxic metals in the washing effluents can be removed almost completely by the use of combined adsorption-neutralization process. This study suggests that soil washing techniques for toxic metals should be optimized based on the physical and chemical properties of the contaminated soils, the nature of chemical extractant, and the removal efficiency and effectiveness of toxic metals from the soils as well as soil washing effluents.","aff1778de16545b095217345513f8999","","eng","naver"

The toxic gases and smokes generated by fires in high-rise buildings spread rapidly through the elevator shaft and stairwell, due to the stack effect, and can cause critical casualties. To reduce the number of casualties, smoke control systems have been introduced. Smoke control systems play an essential role in preventing the spread of smoke in high-rise buildings and securing the evacuation route. Also, in high-rise buildings, evacuation by an elevator is considered to be indispensable. However, the pressure field in the shaft is strongly disturbed when the elevator is moving and this can affect the performance of the smoke control system. Therefore, in this study, we experimentally and numerically analyzed the effect of elevator movement on the pressure difference between the vestibule and living room by building a model using the sandwich pressurization method based on the performance based design. To consider the leakage areas in high-rise buildings, e.g. the windows, fire door and elevator, the National Fire Safety Codes and area ratio were used. The elevator speed in the model building was varied between 20 m/s and 100 m/s corresponding to a real elevator speed of 7 m/s~17 m/s. As a result, the relationship between the pressure difference and elevator speed was found to be ${\Delta}P=40{\cdot}{\exp}$(-Ves /-104.7)-23.735.

As a result, a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) was developed to rear parrotfish. This study investigated the effects of stocking density and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the growth and hematology of the parrotfish in the RAS. The experimental stocking densities were 5 (SD05), 10 (SD10), 15 (SD15), and 20 kg/m3 (SD20) total body weight to tank water volume. As the stocking density increased, the mean weight gain, feed efficiency, and specific growth rate tended to decrease. However, SD10 and SD15 did not differ statistically from SD05 in feed efficiency (P>0.05). Although better growth was achieved in SD05, SD10 and SD15 appeared to be acceptable, practically and economically, in terms of feed efficiency. The experimental DO concentration ranges were 3-4 (DO3), 5-6 (DO5), and 7-8 mg/L (DO7). The mean weight gain and survival tended to increase with the DO concentration, but there were no differences among treatments (P>0.05). Although the feed efficiency did not differ among the treatments, the specific growth rates and daily feed intake increased with the DO concentration and were the highest in DO7 (P<0.05). The cortisol concentration was the highest in DO3 (P<0.05), while there was no difference between DO5 and DO7 (P>0.05).","9d98b5e51fb74a10bb67ad4809c9f958","","eng","naver"

From the test results, although there were small differences between test results and existing research results on the stress-strain relationship, the application to practical structure is not hard. In flexural test, as the produced pattern of displacement and strain were similar to those of general concrete without fly ash, the difference between 50% fly ash concrete and general concrete is very small. And the concrete shear strength obtained by test was similar to that of design code, so existing design code will be also able to apply.","63efd8c0f2c24553994ca9eb1ac8fb7d","","eng","naver"

Recently, geosmin and 2-MIB are detected frequently at abnormally high concentration level. However, conventional water treatment without advanced water treatment processes such as adsorption and oxidation process, cannot remove these two compounds efficiently. Moreover, it is known that the advanced treatment processes i.e. adsorption and oxidation have also several limits to the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB. Therefore, the purpose of this study was not only to evaluate full scale nanofiltration membrane system with $300m^3/day$ of permeate capacity and 90% of recovery on the removal of geosmin and 2-MIB in spiked natural raw water sources at high feed concentration with a range of approximately 500 to 2,500 ng/L, but also to observe rejection property of the compounds within multi stage NF membrane system.

But, according to results of regression analysis in this study it is recommended that feed water concentration of geosmin and 2-MIB would not exceed 220 and 300 ng/L respectively which is not to be perceived in drinking tap water. Also it suggests that the removal rate might be depended on an operating conditions such as feed water characteristics and membrane flux. When each stage of NF membrane system was evaluated relatively higher removal rate was observed at the conditions that is lower flux, higher DOC and TDS, i.e., $2^{nd}$ stage NF membrane systems, possibly due to an interaction mechanisms between compounds and cake layer on the membrane surfaces.","55743dc2495b4e06ae59fa37d6d1f59b","","eng","naver"

In this study several types of insulated meshes were prepared by coating #50 meshes with a dielectric material, Nylon 66, and the filtration property of air filter was evaluated at the presence of external electric field using those insulated meshes as electrodes and compared with that of filters using bared meshes. The collection efficiency of tested filter was increased from 78% to 95% for singly charged 100 nm particles by application of external electric field. As a result, there was no significant difference in collection efficiency between filters with insulated and bared electrodes.

Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted into Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich and Temkin isotherms. Adsorption equilibrium was mostly well described by Langmuir Isotherm. From the estimated separation factor of Langmuir ($R_L$ = 0.023), and Freundlich (1/n = 0.198), this process could be employed as an effective treatment for the adsorption of new fuchsin dye. Also based on the adsorption energy (E = 0.002 kJ/mol) from Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm and the adsorption heat constant (B = 1.920 J/mol) from Temkin isotherm, this adsorption is physical adsorption. From kinetic experiments, the adsorption reaction processes were confirmed following the pseudo second order model with good correlation. The intraparticle diffusion was a rate controlling step. Thermodynamic parameters including changes of free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were also calculated to predict the nature of adsorption. The change of enthalpy (92.49 kJ/mol) and activation energy (11.79 kJ/mol) indicated the endothermic nature of adsorption processes. The change of entropy (313.7 J/mol K) showed an increasing disorder in the adsorption process. The change of free energy found that the spontaneity of process increased with increasing the adsorption temperature.","db031cde49d64a828534a4944ae8a806","","eng","naver"

NFSC 501A specifies that the force necessary to open an access door when operating a smoke control system shall be less than 110 N. When the smoke control system does not operate in the space where it is installed, the door opening force can be measured by the test method in KS F 2805. However, when the smoke control system operates, additional opening force is required to overcome the force generated by the differential pressure between the fire area and smoke control room. Therefore, it can be seen that the method proposed by the standard has insufficient reliability. The analog measuring device and digital measuring device showed that the opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, of the fully closed door before the smoke control system were 27.8 N and 27.4 N, respectively. When the door remained open by $5^{\circ}$, the opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, were 33 N and 33.6 N, respectively. When the smoke control system operated and the door was fully closed, the door opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, were 77.6 N and 76.0 N, respectively. Therefore, since the door opening forces are different from the criteria presented by KS F 2805, it is required to review the criteria appropriately.","d9cf13296c75429191e71aefb105f79b","","eng","naver"

Charged filter and uncharged filter prepared by discharging the charged filter by isopropyl alcohol were used as test samples, and three types of particle having different charge states were supplied to filters tested. For neutralized particles there was a big difference in areal mass loading rates between charged and uncharged filters due to the very small amount of particle charge, on the other hand the difference was diminished for atomized particle and finally almost vanished for corona charged particles. The pressure drop of filter loaded with corona charged particles was only half of those for neutralized and atomized particles at the same areal mass loading because of the porous structure of particle deposit formed on filter fibers, caused by the space charge effect between particles.","5e830a7d8a134fc28b8c972a70d515bf","","eng","naver"

There are many disposal methods to remove odor, but there are many disadvantages and inadequate applications. The Purpose of this study was to develop a bag-filer system for odor removal using powder adsorbent. Methods: The bag-filter system is composed of a shear bag filter, an absorbent spraying system and an absorbent circulation system. The spraying absorbent system was connected with the inlet duct of the shear bag filter for inputting adsorbent. And the absorbent circulation system can transport the collecting adsorbent from hoper to the inlet duct of the system. As a result, the adsorbent can remove odor with recycling in the system. Also affective factors like the powdered absorbent combination and injection method was researched for maximization of system efficiency. The study was conducted in two stages. The first step was testing equipment made and the second is to evaluate the efficiency of the odor control by connecting to the actual odor generation process. Results: Both experiment stages showed efficient odor control ability. The adsorption efficiency of the system is demonstrated and the odor was adsorbed well by the powder adsorbent. It is essential to accurately understand the characteristics of the odorous and use the appropriate adsorbent. Although the powder adsorbent was used in the experiment, the problem of scattering did not occur due to the high degree of system sealing. Also the system manufactured in this study was designed to recycle the adsorbent, so adsorbent reuse or batch processing is convenient. Conclusions: The applicability of the system has been proven through this research. Customized systems for industrial process and the appropriate adsorbent base on the characteristics of pollutant generation will show efficient odor collection ability.","5ef610adce30409d89a3bc0e9b535b08","","eng","naver"

Meanwhile, pressure drops were found increased by 0.3% and 0.37%, respectively when inlet dust concentration and pulse interval were increased by 1% implying that the effects of inlet dust concentration and pulse interval were less as compared with those changes of filtration velocity and pulse pressure. Therefore, the larger effect on the pressure drop the pulse jet bag filter was found in the order of filtration velocity($V_f$), pulse pressure($P_p$), inlet dust concentration($C_i$), pulse interval($P_i$). Also, the prediction result of filtration velocity, inlet dust concentration, pulse pressure, and pulse interval which showed the largest effect on the pressure drop indicated that stable operation can be executed with filtration velocity less than 1.5 m/min and inlet dust concentration less than $4g/m^3$. However, it was regarded that pulse pressure and pulse interval need to be adjusted when inlet dust concentration is higher than $4g/m^3$. When filtration velocity and pulse pressure were examined, operation was possible regardless of changes in pulse pressure if filtration velocity was at 1.5 m/min. If filtration velocity was increased to 2 m/min. operation would be possible only when pulse pressure was set at higher than $5.8kgf/cm^2$. Also, the prediction result of pressure drop with filtration velocity and pulse interval showed that operation with pulse interval less than 50 sec. should be carried out under filtration velocity at 1.5 m/min. While, pulse interval should be set at lower than 11 sec. if filtration velocity was set at 2 m/min. Under the conditions of filtration velocity lower than 1 m/min and high pulse pressure higher than $7kgf/cm^2$, though pressure drop would be less, in this case, economic feasibility would be low due to increased in installation and operation cost since scale of dust collection equipment becomes larger and life of filtration bag becomes shortened due to high pulse pressure.","2831bd0036124bd9b493aceaaab26e97","","eng","naver"

In this study several types of insulated meshes were prepared by coating #50 meshes with a dielectric material, Nylon 66, and the filtration property of air filter was evaluated at the presence of external electric field using those insulated meshes as electrodes and compared with that of filters using bared meshes. The collection efficiency of tested filter was increased from 78% to 95% for singly charged 100 nm particles by application of external electric field.

The C/R structure and air conditioning method were investigated using basic engineering data from documentation for C/R construction. Furthermore, contamination parameters such as airborne particles, temperature, humidity, acids, ammonia, organic compounds, and vibration in the C/R were based on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(ITRS). The properties of contamination control systems and the current status of monitoring of various contaminants in the C/R were investigated. Results: 200 mm and 300 mm wafer fabrication facilities were divided into fab(C/R) and sub fab(Plenum), and fab, clean sub fab and facility sub fab, respectively. Fresh air(FA) is supplied in the plenum or clean sub fab by the outdoor air handling unit system which purifies outdoor air. FA supply or contaminated indoor air ventilation rates in the 200 mm and 300 mm wafer fabrication facilities are approximately 10-25%. Furthermore, semiconductor clean rooms strictly controlled airborne particles(${\leq}1,000{\sharp}/ft^3$), temperature($23{\pm}0.5^{\circ}C$), humidity($45{\pm}5%$), air velocity(0.4 m/s), air change(60-80 cycles/hr), vibration(${\leq}1cm/s^2$), and differential pressure(atmospheric pressure$+1.0-2.5mmH_2O$) through air handling and contamination control systems.

When fly ash is used for concrete manufacturing, it is expected to improve the performance such as reduction of cement usage and increase of chemical resistance. However, fly ash have some problems such as unburned carbon content and amorphous film on the surface of fly ash particles. When concrete is manufactured using fly ash containing a large amount of unburned carbon, there is a problem that the slump is lowered due to adsorption of AE agent. In addition, the amorphous film on the surface of the particles prevents the reactive substances from leaching out of the fly ash. Therefore, a method of surface treatment of fly ash using plasma has been studied to remove such unburned carbon and amorphous films.

Consequently, the ventilation for the supply of outdoor fresh air into a room is treated as an important building-design factor. The ventilation is generally divided into the forced and natural types; here, the former can control the ventilation rate by using mechanical devices, but it has the disadvantages of the equipment costs, maintenance costs, and noise generation, while the latter is applied to most workshops due to the absence of noise and the low installation and maintenance costs. In this experimental study, the ventilation performance of a typical rotating-type natural ventilator, which is called a ""wind turbine,"" was investigated with the outdoor-wind velocity and the indoor/outdoor-temperature difference. From the experiment results, it was confirmed that the temperature difference of $10^{\circ}C$ corresponds to the ventilation driving force with an outdoor-wind velocity of 1.0 m/s.

Methods: NaCl aerosols were generated using an atomizer and passed through cloth masks in a dynamic aerosol chamber. Particle concentrations were measured both before and after for the cloth masks using an optical particle counter (OPC) in the size range of $0.3{\sim}10{\mu}m$. Results: In the original condition, the filtration efficiencies of the five cloth masks were A: 20.1%, B:30.9%, C: 25.0%, D: 26.5%, and E: 40.9%. As the number of washings increased in the order of one, two, and four times, the filtration efficiencies of cloth mask C increased. The filtration efficiency of A, D, and E increased after the first washing. With the exception of B, the filtration efficiency of cloth masks increased after the second washing and those of all cloth masks increased after the fourth washing. This might be caused by the fibers untangling from the yarn and being freed at one end. In this status, the packing density of the textile will not change, but the distances between fibers will increase, which might bring about an increase in filtration efficiency. When the cloth masks were extended by 10% and 20% in one direction, the filtration efficiencies of cloth masks B, D, and E decreased at 10% extension, and those of all cloth masks decreased at 20% extension. When the cloth masks were expanded by 10% and 20% in two directions, the filtration efficiencies of all cloth masks decreased by at least 34.7% at 10% extension, and by at least 60.9% at 20% extension Conclusions: The filtration efficiency of cloth masks could decrease after one to two machine washings, but will increase after four washings in comparison with their original performances. The filtration efficiency of cloth masks will decrease when they are expanded, such as when stretching over the nose during wearing status.","a078bf04258b46b7aa7494b243f95fad","","eng","naver"

Based on the analysis results, the design and production method of the valve are established, and accordingly, performance evaluation is carried out. It is demonstrated that the pressure drop from 345bar to 112bar is more feasible in the presence of the trim, which can induce a continuous and diminutive pressure drop in order to prevent cavitation in a high-pressure drop control valve.

In this study, the adsorption characteristics between soil and Cs were investigated according to various physicochemical properties of soil including organic matter contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil particle size, and the types of clay minerals. Soil organic matter inhibited the adsorption of Cs onto the soil because organic matter was blocking the soil surface.

NFSC 501A specifies that the force necessary to open an access door when operating a smoke control system shall be less than 110 N. When the smoke control system does not operate in the space where it is installed, the door opening force can be measured by the test method in KS F 2805. However, when the smoke control system operates, additional opening force is required to overcome the force generated by the differential pressure between the fire area and smoke control room. Therefore, it can be seen that the method proposed by the standard has insufficient reliability. The analog measuring device and digital measuring device showed that the opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, of the fully closed door before the smoke control system were 27.8 N and 27.4 N, respectively. When the door remained open by $5^{\circ}$, the opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, were 33 N and 33.6 N, respectively. When the smoke control system operated and the door was fully closed, the door opening forces, $F_a$ and $F_d$, were 77.6 N and 76.0 N, respectively. Therefore, since the door opening forces are different from the criteria presented by KS F 2805, it is required to review the criteria appropriately.","ae1c56ddb3494d8bb3c9e2e0d52a05aa","","eng","naver"

The toxic gases and smokes generated by fires in high-rise buildings spread rapidly through the elevator shaft and stairwell, due to the stack effect, and can cause critical casualties. To reduce the number of casualties, smoke control systems have been introduced. Smoke control systems play an essential role in preventing the spread of smoke in high-rise buildings and securing the evacuation route. Also, in high-rise buildings, evacuation by an elevator is considered to be indispensable. However, the pressure field in the shaft is strongly disturbed when the elevator is moving and this can affect the performance of the smoke control system. Therefore, in this study, we experimentally and numerically analyzed the effect of elevator movement on the pressure difference between the vestibule and living room by building a model using the sandwich pressurization method based on the performance based design. To consider the leakage areas in high-rise buildings, e.g. the windows, fire door and elevator, the National Fire Safety Codes and area ratio were used. The elevator speed in the model building was varied between 20 m/s and 100 m/s corresponding to a real elevator speed of 7 m/s~17 m/s. As a result, the relationship between the pressure difference and elevator speed was found to be ${\Delta}P=40{\cdot}{\exp}$(-Ves /-104.7)-23.735.

The door opening force due to differential pressure is 60.75 N, 40.5 N, 32.91 N and 12.66 N when the differential pressure is 60 Pa, 40 Pa, 32.5 Pa and 12.5 Pa, respectively. The door opening force of the floor hinge and door closer to which the criteria of KS F 2806 are applied is 27.5 N, 40 N, 75 N, 100 N and 125 N for the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 class floor hinges and door closers, respectively. This study compared the differential pressure and opening force limits of floor hinges and door closers with the values specified in NFSC 501A and found that they exceeded the criteria specified in NFSC 501A. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect the differential pressure and smoke control wind speeds as well as the opening forces specified in NFSC 501A on the design of floor hinges and door closers. The installation conditions of floor hinges and door closers of access doors differ depending on the type and name of a smoke control damper. This study found that Nos. 1, 2 and 3 floor hinges and door closers could be installed for access doors with low differential pressure and that Nos. 1 and 2 floor hinges and door closers could be installed for access doors with normal differential pressure.","84261dcd163b448ab259ef27a0a3c03e","","eng","naver"

The adsorption efficiency in a bathtub was increased at pH 3 and pH 11 due to the presence of sufonate ions ($SO_3{^-}$) and amine ions ($NH_2{^+}$). The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. The results indicated that the Langmuir model provides the best correlation of the experimental data. The separation factor of the Langmuir and Freundlich model showed that the adsorption treatment of acid blue 40 by activated carbon could be an effective adsorption process. The adsorption energy determined by the Temkin equation showed that the adsorption step is a physical adsorption process. Kinetics analysis of the adsorption process of acid blue 40 on activated carbon showed that a pseudo second order kinetic model is more consistent than a pseudo second order kinetic model. The estimated activation energy was 42.308 kJ/mol. The enthalpy change (80.088 J/mol) indicated an endothermic process. The free energy change (-0.0553 ~ -5.5855 kJ/mol) showed that the spontaneity of the process increased with increasing adsorption temperature.","0330556010044b7ca50bef51ae63a008","","eng","naver"

This study measured the opening force of the access door of the smoke control zone before and after operating the smoke control equipment. The reliability of the opening forces measured by the analog force gauge was verified using the Anderson Darling's statistical analysis method of the Minitab Program. From the fact that all P values of opening force of the access door were less than 0.05 regardless of the operation of the smoke control equipment, the opening force was analyzed to have reliability less than. However, since the of the opening forces of the access doors at all floors shows similar characteristics before and after operating the smoke control equipment, it is analyzed that the accuracy of the measuring device was verified. Therefore, it is thought that major factors for the accurate testing, adjusting and balancing of the pressurized smoke control equipment are accurate calibration of a measuring gauge, correct posture of a measuring person, the same condition of the access doors, etc. In addition, it is thought that human errors can be reduced if the person measuring properly understands the scientific characteristics of the analog force gauge. Therefore, this study proposes that digital and analog force gauges be used together to measure the opening force rather than using only the analog force gauge. It is a scientific approach to reduce errors by performing measurements repeatedly.","","","eng","naver"

For pressurization of the stairs, a blower was used to supply air into the stairwell at one location underground. Thirteen different cases were tested, and test variables included the number of floors with open doors and the flow rate of the air supply. When the doors on the first floor were open, the pressure differential between the stairwell and the auxiliary room was distributed almost uniformly except for locations near the first floor. When the flow rate was in the range of 180~270 CMM and the doors of one floor were open, the flow velocity could satisfy the requirement of fire safety standards and the stairwell pressure was positive at all levels. However, the minimum pressure requirement (10 Pa) could not always be satisfied. When doors on two floors were open, the flow velocity requirement could be satisfied by increasing the flow rate, but it was found impractical to satisfy the minimum pressure requirement without causing excessive pressure differential in the area near the blower.","d90a2e22b97e46a186704fc05b3e3a4c","","eng","naver"

As a result of analysis of fires and smoke in a clean roomas an LCD manufacturing process, it is found to be necessary to stop air handling units through interlocking in case of a fire and exhaust smoke out of the room through the top of FAB in consideration of buoyancy of smoke. It is also found to be necessary to install quick response sprinkler heads and accessories to accelerate the response time, because the heat-accumulating performance of sprinkler heads decreases in this application. Despite its low density of dwelling due to the automation process, clean room is characterized by an array of complex production equipment and working environment requiring dustproof clothes, which makes it difficult to acquire evacuation safety performance.

In Korea, LID techniques were employed since 2012 in order to manage nonpoint source pollutants. LID technology is a technique for removing pollutants using a variety of physical, chemical and biological mechanisms in plants, microorganisms and filter media with the reduced effluence of stormwater runoff by mimicking natural water circulation system.

In this study, the adsorption affinity for Pb in all filter media was higher than Cu. Pseudo second order equation and Langmuir-3 isotherm are more applicable in the adsorption kinetic model and adsorption isotherm model, respectively. As a result of the desorption experiment, the filter media does not exceed KSLT which is the hazardous substance leaching limit, showing the capability of the filter media in LID.

The adsorption efficiency in a bathtub was increased at pH 3 and pH 11 due to the presence of sufonate ions ($SO_3{^-}$) and amine ions ($NH_2{^+}$). The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. The results indicated that the Langmuir model provides the best correlation of the experimental data. The separation factor of the Langmuir and Freundlich model showed that the adsorption treatment of acid blue 40 by activated carbon could be an effective adsorption process. The adsorption energy determined by the Temkin equation showed that the adsorption step is a physical adsorption process. Kinetics analysis of the adsorption process of acid blue 40 on activated carbon showed that a pseudo second order kinetic model is more consistent than a pseudo second order kinetic model. The estimated activation energy was 42.308 kJ/mol. The enthalpy change (80.088 J/mol) indicated an endothermic process. The free energy change (-0.0553 ~ -5.5855 kJ/mol) showed that the spontaneity of the process increased with increasing adsorption temperature.","dc7f2818301d4de4a980e41ad20ad56d","","eng","naver"

When fly ash is used for concrete manufacturing, it is expected to improve the performance such as reduction of cement usage and increase of chemical resistance. However, fly ash have some problems such as unburned carbon content and amorphous film on the surface of fly ash particles. When concrete is manufactured using fly ash containing a large amount of unburned carbon, there is a problem that the slump is lowered due to adsorption of AE agent. In addition, the amorphous film on the surface of the particles prevents the reactive substances from leaching out of the fly ash. Therefore, a method of surface treatment of fly ash using plasma has been studied to remove such unburned carbon and amorphous films. However, plasma has the problem that $O_3$ is generated when $O_2$ is used as an active gas. $O_3$ is a harmful substance and adversely affects the health of the experimenter. In this study, the surface of fly ash was treatment by arc discharge. Experimental results show that the unburned carbon is removed when the surface of fly ash is treatment by arc discharge and the amorphous film was broken and the reactivity was improved. Therefore, it is considered that arc discharge can treatment the surface of fly ash and improve the quality of fly ash.","0204e198b4a84be7983d50c271de7a2a","","eng","naver"

With the increasingly growing market share of the maritime industry, this valve has been expected to be a high-value-added product. This study not only analyzes the relation between pressure drop and fluid velocity in a trim by using fluid analysis, but also examines the possibility of cavitation in a valve in addition to the plot for the extension of lifespan. Based on the analysis results, the design and production method of the valve are established, and accordingly, performance evaluation is carried out. It is demonstrated that the pressure drop from 345bar to 112bar is more feasible in the presence of the trim, which can induce a continuous and diminutive pressure drop in order to prevent cavitation in a high-pressure drop control valve.

Methods: This study was conducted at 200 mm and 300 mm semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. The C/R structure and air conditioning method were investigated using basic engineering data from documentation for C/R construction. Furthermore, contamination parameters such as airborne particles, temperature, humidity, acids, ammonia, organic compounds, and vibration in the C/R were based on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(ITRS). The properties of contamination control systems and the current status of monitoring of various contaminants in the C/R were investigated. Results: 200 mm and 300 mm wafer fabrication facilities were divided into fab(C/R) and sub fab(Plenum), and fab, clean sub fab and facility sub fab, respectively. Fresh air(FA) is supplied in the plenum or clean sub fab by the outdoor air handling unit system which purifies outdoor air.

We also examined how changes of differential pressure by each filter have influenced energy consumption, using the power usage effectiveness (PUE). Results show that the PUE was improved, and energy consumption decreased, by applying the air-side economizer system.","de339636abf14587968e44eb2fbba4ee","","eng","naver"

When fly ash is used for concrete manufacturing, it is expected to improve the performance such as reduction of cement usage and increase of chemical resistance. However, fly ash have some problems such as unburned carbon content and amorphous film on the surface of fly ash particles. When concrete is manufactured using fly ash containing a large amount of unburned carbon, there is a problem that the slump is lowered due to adsorption of AE agent. In addition, the amorphous film on the surface of the particles prevents the reactive substances from leaching out of the fly ash. Therefore, a method of surface treatment of fly ash using plasma has been studied to remove such unburned carbon and amorphous films. However, plasma has the problem that $O_3$ is generated when $O_2$ is used as an active gas. $O_3$ is a harmful substance and adversely affects the health of the experimenter.

However, there have been insufficient studies on the reduction of the exhaust emission for old diesel vehicles. To develop careful inspection systems for the exhaust emissions of old diesel vehicles, studies on the reduction of the exhaust emissions and improvement of power are necessary by cleaning the carbon sediment in both the intake manifold and injector. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed and compared the amounts of gas emitted when simultaneously cleaning or not cleaning the intake manifold and injector of diesel automobiles with mileages over 80,000 km and operating periods over 5 years. The experimental results showed that in the case where the intake manifold and injector were simultaneously cleaned, there was a decline of 75.2% in the gas emission compared to the cases where only the manifold or injector is cleaned. Also, it was found that simultaneously cleansing the intake manifold and injector enabled the exhaust standard to be satisfied for less than 30% within 8.5 sec.","e3b1ecb2e1054f1cadeb80b4baf77c13","","eng","naver"

Here, we combine correlative electron and light microscopy and mathematical growth laws to study the ultrastructural rearrangements of the clathrin coat during endocytosis in BSC-1 mammalian cells. We confirm that clathrin coats initially grow flat and demonstrate that curvature begins when around 70% of the final clathrin content is acquired.

From this finding, it is also known that most of sediment are removed within a certain length of vegetative filter strips. It is concluded that the installation of vegetative filter strip is determined under the consideration of the rainfall characteristics, space of vegetation, and length of vegetative filter strip.","1b085a4fc86f475380a59b505f3d9b32","","eng","naver"

Among contaminated elements in the mine drainage, Mn is one of the difficult elements for the treatment because it needs high pH over 9.0 for its concentration to be reduced. In this study, the efficiency of various slag complex reactors (slag (S), slag+limestone (SL) and slag+Mn coated gravel (SG)) on Mn removal in the presence of Fe, which is a competitive element with Mn, was evaluated to investigate effective methods for the treatment of Mn in mine drainage. As a result of experiments on Mn removal without Fe during 358 days, using influent with $30{\sim}50Mn{\cdot}mg/L$ and pH 6.7 on the average, S reactor showed continuously high Mn removal efficiency with the average of 99.9% with pH 8.9~11.4. Using the same reactors, Mn removal experiments with Fe during 237 days were conducted with the influent with $40{\sim}60Mn{\cdot}mg/L$. The pH range of effluent reached to 6.1~10.0, which is slightly lower than that of effluent without Fe. S reactor showed the highest range of pH with 7.1~9.9, followed by S+L and S+G reactor. However, the efficiency of Mn removal showed S+L>S>S+G with the range of 94~100%, 68~100% and 68~100%, respectively in spite of relatively low pH range. S+L reactor showed the most resistance on Fe input, which means other mechanisms such as $MnCO_3$ formation by the carbonate prouced from the limestone or autocatalysis reaction of Mn contributed to Mn removal rather than pH related mechanisms. The evidence of reactions between carbonates and Mn, rhodochrosite ($MnCO_3$), was found from the X-ray diffraction analysis of precipitates sample from S+L reactor. From this study, the most effective reactors on Mn removal in the presence of Fe was S+L reactor.

The main objective of the ventilation system is to supply sufficient air to dilute the contaminated air at working places and consequently provide tenable environment during the normal operation, while it also should be capable of controlling the fire propagation and facilitate rescue conditions in case of fire in mines. In this study, a smoke control fan was developed for the auxiliary ventilation as well as the fire smoke exhaust. It works as a free-standing auxiliary fan without tubing to dilute or exhaust the contaminated air from the working places. At the same time, it can be employed to extract the fire smoke. This paper aims to examine the smoke control efficiency of the fan when combined with the current ventilation system in mines. A series of the site experiments and numerical simulations were made to evaluate the fan performance in blind entry development sites. The tracer gas method with SF6 was applied to investigate the contaminant behavior at the study sites. The results of the site study at a large-opening limestone mine were compared with the CFD analysis results with respect to the airflow pattern and the gas concentration. This study shows that in blind development entry, the most polluted and risky place, the smoke fan can exhaust toxic gases or fire smoke effectively if it is properly combined with an additional common auxiliary fan. The venturi effect for smoke exhaust from the blind entry was also observed by the numerical analysis.

But RICEWQ was insufficient to predict exposure concentrations in ground water.

The result of measuring the photon fluence by using RQA-M2 Radiation beam quality of IEC 61223-1-2 recommendations, the incident photon fluence could be defined as about $4 photons/(0.01mm)^2{\cdot}{\mu}Gy$ within $10{\mu}m$ pin-hole area, and about $50photons/(0.03mm)^2{\cdot}{\mu}Gy$ within $30{\mu}m$ pin-hole area, and about $698photons/(0.1mm)^2{\cdot}{\mu}Gy$ within $100{\mu}m$ pin-hole area. Consequently, with the previously setup of the incident fluence, the measuring of actual photon counting efficiency by observing the output waveform of the photon counting sensor material was considered possible.","0777a0f1f6d242a999ec9614546f04d4","","eng","naver"

The scrubbing efficiency of the newly developed wet scrubber was found to be over 95% under the condition of flue gas flow rate of 90CMM and liquid-to-gas ratio $2l/m^3$ for all considered trials of experimental design. The interaction effect between the inlet duct spray and the filter was found to be important, which controls the droplet growth due to the droplet collisions between the duct- and scrubbing tower-spray. The presented methodology to analyze the impacts of operational and design factors on the scrubber efficiency showed potential for applications to optimize the future flue gas abatement process in semiconductor plants.","48d5d79dcec547e59b595cb07efd8f3f","","eng","naver"

In addition, we perform circuit-level simulations using Advanced Design System, and show that the achievable PTE is different for the structures of resonators when k>$k_{split}$. We confirm that higher PTE can be ensured as k increases in the case of identical resonators, while PTE is degraded as k increases in the case of non-identical resonators. Therefore, in short distance, in which k>$k_{split}$, it is more efficient for achieving reliable PTE to use identical resonators rather than non-identical resonators.","e1c15d344aa04c47881a23c05ecc739d","","eng","naver"

To maintain the optimal performance of an electronic control diesel engine, it is important to control the fuel injection pressure accurately using the fuel pressure regulator. When the fuel pressure regulator is not worked normally, the failure phenomena (starting failure, staring delay, accelerated failure, engine mismatch et al.) occurred because the fuel pressure is not stabilized and controlled accurately. In this study, the effects on a fuel pressure, return fuel mass flow, and engine rotating speed according to the control rate of fuel pressure regulator were investigated to analyze the performance variation under the failure conditions of a fuel pressure regulator. As a result, when the control rate of a fuel pressure regulator decreased by 4%~6% compared to that of the standard condition, the variation of engine rotating speed and return fuel flow were increased greatly, and the abnormal condition occurred.

Methods: In a chamber with a volume of $1m^3$, air velocity was measured at six different points with four roof fans in the upper part of the chamber being operated in order. The impact of the ventilation conditions was analyzed when the flow rates were increasing and the first inlet of the chamber was either open or closed. Smoke patterns were also observed at four corner points where ventilation was limited. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare air velocities measured in the chamber. Results: The air velocities measured at only the third point increased significantly from $0.03{\pm}0.03m/s$ (door open) and $0.05{\pm}0.06m/s$ (door closed) with two fans, $0.08{\pm}0.08m/s$ with three fans, and $0.09{\pm}0.09m/s$ with four fans operating (p<0.05). However, air velocities at the four corner points did not significantly increase. Smoke patters also showed that the open inlet of the chamber had no effect on improvement of ventilation conditions and effectiveness. Conclusions: In this study, the air velocities at six points in the chamber did not significantly increase despite the increase in the mixing factor and flow rates of ventilation in the controlled environment. Therefore, the inflow of outdoor air throughout an open inlet and installation of a forced ventilation system can potentially increase the indoor air velocity and improve ventilation condition without an increase in the mixing factor.","d185fe2a934a41d1a1968eebff86723f","","eng","naver"

In this study, transparent hydrophobic anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings made of $SiO_2/TiO_2$ thin layers were fabricated on a slide glass substrate by the sol-gel and dip-coating processes. The morphology of the functional coatings was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optical properties of the functional coatings were investigated using an UV-visible spectrophotometer. Contact angle measurements were performed to confirm the hydrophobicity of the surface. The results showed that the $TiO_2$ films exhibit a high transmittance comparable to that of the bare slide glass substrate. The $TiO_2$ nanoparticles make the film more reflective and lead to a lower transmittance.

Therefore, the improvement of energy efficiency in old detached houses is needed from the viewpoint of energy welfare. The general method of building energy modelling for the verification of energy efficiency is based on the construction year data of ""Building Design Criteria for Energy Saving"" due to the cost and time involved in collecting the thermal performance data of buildings. There is poor accuracy with the deterioration of long-term aging of building materials. Also, the selection of alternatives for energy performance improvement is based on the items to be applied, not a performance improvement goal. It is difficult to calculate energy performance that reflects variations in various parameters with dynamic energy simulations. In this study, the influence of long-term aging is used to accurately predict the energy performance of old detached houses. The building energy modelling method is called ENERGY#, which is a static analysis method based on ISO13790. Energy performance is evaluated by a combination of input variables including building orientation, insulation of walls and roof, thermal performance of windows and window/wall ratio, and infiltration rate.

Since an electric two-wheeled vehicle covered in this paper is lighter than an electric four-wheeled vehicle, the improvement of its driving distance per battery charge through regenerative braking is different from an electric four-wheeled vehicle.

Among the fields where energy consumption is high, the electric heating equipment is not efficient. The electric boiler mainly uses a method of circulating water by contacting the heater. When the existing electric boiler is used, the water minerals are contacted with the high-temperature heater to be carbonized and adsorbed, thereby promoting the corrosion of the heater and lowering the efficiency of the heater. For this reason, an electric induction boiler, which has high energy efficiency and is applied to an induction heating system that can uniformly heat the object to be heated rather than conduction or convection heating, is in the limelight. This method induces a boiler pipe And it is recognized as an alternative that can solve the problem that occurs when heating is performed by direct heating. Despite the fact that research on induction heating has been conducted for a relatively long period of time, there have been few studies on the electrothermal technology using induction heating. Therefore, in this paper, to improve the heat efficiency of electric induction boiler, the influence of the cross sectional area, number of windings and winding layers is analyzed by finite element method through parametric study method. The method of finding the design point which maximizes the total loss is proposed by the alternating winding design method which can maximize the heat generation by analyzing copper and iron losses.","d04e59d2b12f4ba28a274ff3ab81ba58","","eng","naver"

Here, we combine correlative electron and light microscopy and mathematical growth laws to study the ultrastructural rearrangements of the clathrin coat during endocytosis in BSC-1 mammalian cells. We confirm that clathrin coats initially grow flat and demonstrate that curvature begins when around 70% of the final clathrin content is acquired.

A roughing process was carried out using sandpaper and sand blasting. The changes in surface roughness and surface area after each surface treatment process were evaluated quantitatively and the convective heat transfer coefficient was measured. When sandblasting and sandpaper were used to roughen the aluminum surface, a higher convection heat transfer coefficient was obtained compared to the untreated case, and a high heat dissipation efficiency of 82.76% was obtained in the sandblast treatment.

In this paper, drying performances were evaluated with and without hydrothermal reaction of organic wastes which are sewage sludge and food wastes. For the hydrothermal reaction, organic wastes were treated at $200^{\circ}C$ for 1hr. Drying time of treated organic waste by hydrothermal reaction was reduced. In case of food waste drying at $100^{\circ}C$, drying time of treated wasted was reduced more 52.9% than non-treated.

Drying rates of treated wastes were considerably increased at preheat period of drying characteristic curve as followings; at $80^{\circ}C$ sludge as 148%, $100^{\circ}C$ sewage sludge as 151%, $80^{\circ}C$ food waste as 209%, $100^{\circ}C$ food waste as 366%.

Methods: Soft lenses made of different materials (etafilcon A and hilafilcon B) were deposited tear proteins by using the artificial tear and then compared the resulting cleaning efficacy and visible light transmittance after cleaning the lens with 6 types of multi-purpose solutions containing different content of surfactants. Results: The cleaning efficacy of multi-purpose solutions was variously shown as approximately 23~43% according to the active concentration of surfactants and surface tension in multi-purpose solution when etafilcon A lens cleaned with rubbing. The highest cleaning efficacy was detected when cleaned with the multi-purpose solution containing hydrogen peroxide besides surfactant however, the amount of remaining protein was still high on the lens. After washed with multi-purpose solution, the visible light transmittance of lens was in 89.8 to 90.8%. The amount of protein deposited on hilafilcon B lens was very small compared with it on etafilcon A lens even though it was incubated in artificial tears for 7 days, which showed 5~10% of protein amount in etafilcon A lens and the decrease of visible light transmittance was also not significant.

Flotation using $CO_2$ as an alternative to air could be effective in overcoming the high power consumption in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process. The comparison of DAF and DCF system indicated that, the carbon dioxide flotation (DCF) system with pressurized $CO_2$ only requires 1.5 ~ 2.0 atm, while the DAF system requires 3.0 ~ 6.0 atm. In a bid to understand the characteristics of particle separation, the single collector collision (SCC) model was used and a series of simulations were conducted to compare the differences of collision and flotation between $CO_2$ bubbles and air bubbles. In addition, laboratory experiments were sequentially done to verify the simulation results of the SCC model. Based on the simulation results, surfactant injection, which is known to decrease bubble size, cloud improved the collision efficiency of $CO_2$ bubbles similar to that of air bubbles. Furthermore, the results of the flotation experiments showed similar results with the simulation of the SCC model under anionic surfactant injection. The findings led us to conclude that $CO_2$ bubbles can be an alternative to air bubbles and a promising material as a collector to separate particles in the water and wastewater.","7e03a29547d3456a8f2346c44fcbb702","","eng","naver"

Many researches have focused on developing the breakthrough adsorbent to increase the cesium removal efficiency in water. In this study, the laboratory scale experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal for the Cs contaminated water system. The Cs removal efficiency of the bamboo charcoal were measured and the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by the adsorption batch experiments. Total 5 types of commercialized bamboo charcoals in Korea were used to identify their surface properties from SEM-EDS and XRD analyses and 3 types of bamboo charcoals having large specific surface areas were used for the adsorption batch experiment. The batch experiments to calculate the Cs removal efficiency were performed at conditions of various Cs concentration (0.01 - 10 mg/L), pH (3 - 11), temperature ($5-30^{\circ}C$), and adsorption time (10 - 120 min.). Experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm curve and their adsorption constants were determined to understand the adsorption properties of bamboo charcoal for Cs contaminated water system. From results of SEM-EDS analyses, the surfaces of bamboo charcoal particles were composed of typical fiber structures having various pores and dense lamella structures in supporting major adsorption spaces for Cs. From results of adsorption batch experiments, the Cs-133 removal efficiency of C type bamboo charcoal was the highest among those of 3 bamboo charcoal types and it was higher than 75 % (maximum of 82 %) even when the initial Cs concentration in water was lower than 1.0 mg/L, suggesting that the adsorption process using the bamboo charcoal has a great potential to remove Cs from the genuine Cs contaminated water, of which Cs concentration is low (< 1.0 mg/L) in general. The high Cs removal efficiency of bamboo charcoal was maintained in a relatively wide range of temperatures and pHs, supporting that the usage of the bamboo charcoal is feasible for various types of water. Experimental results were similar to the Langmuir adsorption model and the maximum amount of Cs adsorption (qm:mg/g) was 63.4 mg/g, which was higher than those of commercialized adsorbents used in previous studies. The surface coverage (${\theta}$) of bamboo charcoal was also maintained in low when the Cs concentration in water was < 1.0 mg/L, investigating that the Cs contaminated water can be remediated up with a small amount of bamboo charcoal.","ff7e4c0a5d2048bdaaa955d57270fbb4","","eng","naver"

Flotation using $CO_2$ as an alternative to air could be effective in overcoming the high power consumption in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process. The comparison of DAF and DCF system indicated that, the carbon dioxide flotation (DCF) system with pressurized $CO_2$ only requires 1.5 ~ 2.0 atm, while the DAF system requires 3.0 ~ 6.0 atm. In a bid to understand the characteristics of particle separation, the single collector collision (SCC) model was used and a series of simulations were conducted to compare the differences of collision and flotation between $CO_2$ bubbles and air bubbles. In addition, laboratory experiments were sequentially done to verify the simulation results of the SCC model.

It is difficult to calculate energy performance that reflects variations in various parameters with dynamic energy simulations. In this study, the influence of long-term aging is used to accurately predict the energy performance of old detached houses. The building energy modelling method is called ENERGY#, which is a static analysis method based on ISO13790. Energy performance is evaluated by a combination of input variables including building orientation, insulation of walls and roof, thermal performance of windows and window/wall ratio, and infiltration rate.

This phenomenon led to increased light scattering, which in turn increased the current density of the dye-sensitized solar cells and improved the solar conversion efficiency.","ef8bd4acf549438e9fb0192269908056","","eng","naver"

When the existing electric boiler is used, the water minerals are contacted with the high-temperature heater to be carbonized and adsorbed, thereby promoting the corrosion of the heater and lowering the efficiency of the heater.

Results: The air velocities measured at only the third point increased significantly from $0.03{\pm}0.03m/s$ (door open) and $0.05{\pm}0.06m/s$ (door closed) with two fans, $0.08{\pm}0.08m/s$ with three fans, and $0.09{\pm}0.09m/s$ with four fans operating (p<0.05). However, air velocities at the four corner points did not significantly increase. Smoke patters also showed that the open inlet of the chamber had no effect on improvement of ventilation conditions and effectiveness. Conclusions: In this study, the air velocities at six points in the chamber did not significantly increase despite the increase in the mixing factor and flow rates of ventilation in the controlled environment. Therefore, the inflow of outdoor air throughout an open inlet and installation of a forced ventilation system can potentially increase the indoor air velocity and improve ventilation condition without an increase in the mixing factor.","3e6854540e4847efa701502a4241a25b","","eng","naver"

This behaviour may create a sexual conflict, because females could lose the sperm stored in the spermatheca, used for long-term storage. Comparative evidence suggested antagonistic coevolution between sexes, which might prompt the evolution of narrow spermathecal ducts, or longer spermathecae, hindering sperm removal. Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis and C. splendens coexist and sometimes hybridize. Therefore, here I predicted that if females coevolve with conspecific males, heterospecific males should have an advantage when interspecific matings occur because females will show less resistance to them than to conspecific males. By hand-pairing females to males of both species, I found that in intraspecific and interspecific matings, sperm was almost completely removed from the bursa (97–100%), but only partially from the spermathecae, with more spermathecal removal in interspecific (63–71%) than intraspecific matings (14–33%). This suggests that heterospecific males are more efficient in sperm removal as predicted by a sexually-antagonistic coevolutionary scenario. Furthermore, in most cases, only the left spermatheca was emptied, suggesting that the evolution of more than one spermatheca might also be a female counter-adaptation to regain control over fertilization.","5b33d39813bd449d97258cd62527adf1","","eng",""

This behaviour may create a sexual conflict, because females could lose the sperm stored in the spermatheca, used for long-term storage. Comparative evidence suggested antagonistic coevolution between sexes, which might prompt the evolution of narrow spermathecal ducts, or longer spermathecae, hindering sperm removal. Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis and C. splendens coexist and sometimes hybridize. Therefore, here I predicted that if females coevolve with conspecific males, heterospecific males should have an advantage when interspecific matings occur because females will show less resistance to them than to conspecific males. By hand-pairing females to males of both species, I found that in intraspecific and interspecific matings, sperm was almost completely removed from the bursa (97–100%), but only partially from the spermathecae, with more spermathecal removal in interspecific (63–71%) than intraspecific matings (14–33%). This suggests that heterospecific males are more efficient in sperm removal as predicted by a sexually-antagonistic coevolutionary scenario. Furthermore, in most cases, only the left spermatheca was emptied, suggesting that the evolution of more than one spermatheca might also be a female counter-adaptation to regain control over fertilization.","e3808bd5f53448cb97a562ad3fc76382","","eng",""

Methods: Soft lenses made of different materials (etafilcon A and hilafilcon B) were deposited tear proteins by using the artificial tear and then compared the resulting cleaning efficacy and visible light transmittance after cleaning the lens with 6 types of multi-purpose solutions containing different content of surfactants. Results: The cleaning efficacy of multi-purpose solutions was variously shown as approximately 23~43% according to the active concentration of surfactants and surface tension in multi-purpose solution when etafilcon A lens cleaned with rubbing. The highest cleaning efficacy was detected when cleaned with the multi-purpose solution containing hydrogen peroxide besides surfactant however, the amount of remaining protein was still high on the lens. After washed with multi-purpose solution, the visible light transmittance of lens was in 89.8 to 90.8%. The amount of protein deposited on hilafilcon B lens was very small compared with it on etafilcon A lens even though it was incubated in artificial tears for 7 days, which showed 5~10% of protein amount in etafilcon A lens and the decrease of visible light transmittance was also not significant.

Conclusions: From the result, it is concluded that the appropriate multi-purpose solution should be selected according to the lens material and the amount of protein deposit on the basis of understanding surfactants and active principle for proper care of protein deposit on soft lens and the cleaning with rubbing is more efficient for lens care regardless of manufacturer's guideline.","4fa064ec38e148218a0a5f33a92ee8c5","","eng","naver"

It is shown that neglect of the cross modes results in overestimation of the radiation efficiency specifically for mid-frequency ranges. Based on the fact that the responses are mainly determined from the first few cross modes in addition to the diagonal terms, a new algorithm is proposed, where banded matrix is iteratively solved in computing radiation efficiency. In numerical examples, it is found that radiation efficiency obtained from banded matrix is in excellent agreement with the one from the full matrix, while computing time is significantly reduced. It is also found that as frequency grows larger, radiation efficiency considering only diagonal terms is a good approximation.","a2ac3d012df3400992755e1b5c7c0c42","","eng","naver"

By adding Ag which plays a role as an electron capture on the ZnO catalyst, the performance increased due to the recombination of excited electrons and holes. In particular, $8.60{\mu}mol\;g^{-1}$ $H_2$ was produced after 10 h reaction over the 0.50 mol% Ag/ZnO.","249c6795931343c597a2bd057e5fb205","","eng","naver"

In this study, the effect of ammonia as impurity during the co-precipitation process was investigated in order to re-synthesize a precursor of Ni-rich cathode active material $LiNi_{0.6}Co_{0.2}Mn_{0.2}O_2$ (NCM 622). As ammonia concentration increases from 1 M (the optimum condition for synthesis of the precursors based on 2 M of metal salt solution) to 4 M, the composition of obtained precursors deviates from the designed composition, most notably for Ni. The Ni co-precipitation efficiency gradually decreases from 100% to 87% when the concentration of ammonia solution increases from 1 M to 4 M. Meanwhile, the morphological properties of the obtained precursors such as sphericity, homogeneity and size distribution of particles were also investigated.","1a30bbed254e4aa19377836729238355","","eng","naver"

The phase change in MnO2 was analyzed according to the reaction molar ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(CH3COO)2. The reaction mole ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was varied at 0.3:1, 0.6:1, and 1:1. The aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2 was injected into a mixed solution of KMnO4 and Mn(CH3COO)2 to 10~75 wt% relative to MnO2. The Cu ion co-precipitates as CuO with MnO2 in a highly dispersed state on MnO2. The physicochemical property of the prepared CuO/MnO2 was analyzed by using the TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, and BET. The different phase types of MnO2 were prepared according to the reaction mole ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O. The results confirmed that the porous CuO/MnO2 catalyst with γ-phase MnO2 was produced in the reaction mole ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(CH3COO)2 as 0.6:1 at room temperature.","4e147a42b40a4cbbb9ee84e14f77bf1e","","eng","naver"

A series of magnesium substitutions ranging from 0, 0.5, and 1.0 wt%, which are comparable to the measured magnesium contents, were performed. The obtained powders were characterized by the following analytical techniques: X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results have shown that substitution of magnesium in the calcium-deficient apatites resulted in the formation of biphasic mixtures of different HAP/${\beta}$-TCP ratios after heating above $1000^{\circ}C$. The 1.0 wt% magnesiumsubstituted-BCP were soaked in Hank's solutions after 2 weeks to observe the morphology of the biocement, especially needle-like hydroxyapatite crystals and to estimate the length and diameter of nanoneedle crystals.","b48ecfa0b4dc4580b12fed395fa9aec0","","eng","naver"

The size of AP-immobilized iron oxide particle is about 39 nm. Intracellular uptake of the AP-immobilized iron oxide nanoparticles was investigated using bladder cancer cells and fibroblasts as the control. As the result, the nanoparticles are specificially uptaken by bladder cancer cells. However, the nanoparticles are not specificially uptaken by fibroblast.

Our XRD results show that most schwertmannite were transformed to goethite except the small portions of the samples in the uppermost part. No significant morphological changes were observed in the samples during mineral transformation by SEM, indicating that this transformation process occurred not from dissolution-precipitation process, but in solid state. Among heavy metals sorbed or coprecipitated in the mineral phases, Pb and Cu concentrations were relatively higher compared with their concentrations in the mine drainage. The relative concentrations of other heavy metals show similar values. The heavy metal concentration in the minerals do not show noticeable differences from uppermost schwertmannite to lower goethite samples, indicating the transformation process without any leaching or additional sorption of heavy metals in the solid state.","a7bbe0b783bd466a862785ad50bb44df","","eng","naver"

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), $N_2$ sorption, and $NH_3/1$-butene-temperature programmed desorption ($NH_3/1$-butene-TPD) to correlate with catalytic activity in ODH reaction. Among the catalysts studied here, $BiFe_{0.65}MoP_{0.1}$ oxide catalyst prepared with co-precipitation method marked the highest activity showing 1-butene conversion, 79.5%, butadiene selectivity, 85.1% and yield, 67.7% after reaction for 14 h.

In addition, combined with the 1-butene TPD, the higher catalytic activity is closely related to the amount of weakly adsorbed intermediate (< $200^{\circ}C$) and the desorbing temperature of strongly adsorbed intermediates (> $200^{\circ}C$).","b9a5dcb2c45d498a9e54a27b382ec54d","","eng","naver"
