This behaviour may create a sexual conflict, because females could lose the sperm stored in the spermatheca, used for long-term storage. Comparative evidence suggested antagonistic coevolution between sexes, which might prompt the evolution of narrow spermathecal ducts, or longer spermathecae, hindering sperm removal. Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis and C. splendens coexist and sometimes hybridize. Therefore, here I predicted that if females coevolve with conspecific males, heterospecific males should have an advantage when interspecific matings occur because females will show less resistance to them than to conspecific males. By hand-pairing females to males of both species, I found that in intraspecific and interspecific matings, sperm was almost completely removed from the bursa (97?100%), but only partially from the spermathecae, with more spermathecal removal in interspecific (63?71%) than intraspecific matings (14?33%). This suggests that heterospecific males are more efficient in sperm removal as predicted by a sexually-antagonistic coevolutionary scenario. Furthermore, in most cases, only the left spermatheca was emptied, suggesting that the evolution of more than one spermatheca might also be a female counter-adaptation to regain control over fertilization.",5b33d39813bd449d97258cd62527adf1,,eng,

The scaffold is composed of single-layered graphene (SG) or multi-layered graphene (MG) and polycaprolactone (PCL). The electrically conductive 3D graphene scaffold can significantly improve neural expression both in vitro and in vivo.

However, the potential therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Autophagy plays an important role in CKD. However, there were some important related issues that remained unresolved in the role of autophagy in CKD and treatment by rhubarb and rhein. We designed a number of experiments to examine whether rhubarb may reduce renal fibrosis and autophagy in rats with adenine (Ade)-induced renal tubular injury, and whether rhein could affect autophagic pathways in rat renal tubular cells. We found that, autophagic activation accompanied with renal fibrosis in rats with Ade-induced renal tubular injury, and both autophagy and renal fibrosis were attenuated by rhubarb. In addition, we observed that rhein could inhibit autophagy through regulating the key molecules in the AMPK-dependent mTOR signaling pathways, as well as the Erk and p38 MAPKs signaling pathways. These findings may partly explain the therapeutic mechanisms of rhubarb and rhein in treating CKD patients in clinic, and further suggest that targeting autophagy and related signaling pathways may provide new strategies for the treatment of renal fibrosis in CKD.",cf313269502b433987376cd00e258757,,eng,

It was confirmed that the adsorbent prepared from water treatment sludge contained Br$\ddot{o}$nsted and Lewis acid sites. The breakthrough time of the adsorbent for both trimethylamine and ammonia was measured at different adsorbent weights and linear velocities while maintaining constant amounts of trimethylamine and ammonia. The kinetic saturation capacity and the adsorption rate constant for trimethylamine and ammonia were determined at different linear velocities by using the Wheeler equation. It was found that the kinetic saturation capacity and the adsorption rate constant were dependent on the linear velocity. An experimental equation could be derived to predict the breakthrough time of the adsorbent prepared from water treatment sludge for trimethylamine and ammonia at different adsorption conditions.,fb60a0a3bdc4421a86fc0b7770b383d8,,eng,naver
