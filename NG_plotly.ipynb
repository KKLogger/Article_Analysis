Do not remove this.\\n\\n\\n**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**\\n\\n**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**\\n\\n*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*\\n\\nInformation on contacting Project Gutenberg to get Etexts, and\\nfurther information is included below.  We need your donations.\\n\\n\\nA Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\\n\\nby William Shakespeare [Collins edition]\\n\\nNovember, 1998 [Etext #1514]\\n[Most recently updated: July 2, 2003]\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg Etext of A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream by Shakespeare\\n******This file should be named 1514.txt or 1514.zip******\\n\\nThis etext was prepared by the PG Shakespeare Team,\\na team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,\\nall of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a\\ncopyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep\\nthese books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\\n\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\n\\n\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\n\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-\\nMellon University).\\n\\nFor these and other matters, please mail to:\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\nP. O.

Name what part I am for, and proceed.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nWhat is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?\\n\\nQUINCE\\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it.\\nIf I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move\\nstorms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest:--yet my\\nchief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a\\npart to tear a cat in, to make all split.\\n\\nThe raging rocks\\nAnd shivering shocks\\nShall break the locks\\n    Of prison gates:\\n\\nAnd Phibbus\\' car\\nShall shine from far,\\nAnd make and mar\\n    The foolish Fates.\\n\\nThis was lofty.--Now name the rest of the players.--This is\\nErcles\\' vein, a tyrant\\'s vein;--a lover is more condoling.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\\n\\nFLUTE\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nFlute, you must take Thisby on you.\\n\\nFLUTE\\nWhat is Thisby? a wandering knight?\\n\\nQUINCE\\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\\n\\nFLUTE\\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nThat\\'s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as\\nsmall as you will.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nAn I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too:\\nI\\'ll speak in a monstrous little voice;--\\'Thisne, Thisne!\\'--\\n\\'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady dear!\\'\\n\\nQUINCE\\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nWell, proceed.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\\n\\nSTARVELING\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisby\\'s mother.--\\nTom Snout, the tinker.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nYou, Pyramus\\' father; myself, Thisby\\'s father;--Snug,\\nthe joiner, you, the lion\\'s part:--and, I hope, here is a play\\nfitted.\\n\\nSNUG\\nHave you the lion\\'s part written? pray you, if it be, give it\\nme, for I am slow of study.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nLet me play the lion too: I will roar that I will do\\nany man\\'s heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the\\nduke say \\'Let him roar again, let him roar again.\\'\\n\\nQUINCE\\nAn you should do it too terribly, you would fright the\\nduchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were\\nenough to hang us all.\\n\\nALL\\nThat would hang us every mother\\'s son.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies\\nout of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang\\nus: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as\\ngently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an \\'twere any\\nnightingale.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nYou can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a\\nsweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer\\'s\\nday; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must\\nneeds play Pyramus.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\\n\\nQUINCE\\nWhy, what you will.\\n\\nBOTTOM\\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,\\nyour orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\\n\\nQUINCE\\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and\\nthen you will play bare-faced.-- But, masters, here are your\\nparts: and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to\\ncon them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a\\nmile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse: for\\nif we meet in the city, we shall be dogg\\'d with company, and our\\ndevices known.
